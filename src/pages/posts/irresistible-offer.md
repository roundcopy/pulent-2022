Humans are mostly not rational. We are born irrational and with time are trained to be sensible, to build our mental models preparing ourselves for future challenges. We are even considered it offensive when someone calls us irrational. But despite this, I would argue that precisely this irrationality is making us interesting while creating negotiation opportunities.

So why are we always creating offers with mathematical precision? Does it even make sense to invest time in designing an offer without spending at least the same amount of time in understanding our buyer?

Could this kind of pricing model be built with buyers irrationality counted in, and could we even develop a system for creating such models?

I had an opportunity to approach a potential new client in the name of a company that I advised at that time. The usual practice was to provide the approached lead with a price list and offer them a fixed percentage discount which would increase with the endurance of the relationship. This was typical for the industry, and both sides expected such interaction negotiating on the discount percentage and driving the price low as it goes. Negotiations were done face to face with intermittent phone calls. We could have been selling nails or parachutes it wouldn't make the difference.

I needed to understand the dynamics and all the peculiarities, including the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. I drafted a small to-do list:

1. Discover everything about the product.
2. Understand the current pricing strategy.
3. Deconstruct current offer strategy.
4. Find out what the competition was doing.
5. Identify the job-to-be-done for the client.

Honestly, there is a shortcut. You could jump straight to number 5. and then work from there.

Recognising those "exotic" dimensions in the forest of circumstances such as product attributes, new technologies or trends will provide you with ultimate leverage.

One typical circumstance is that your client has clients, and knowing them could be the first key. Based on this insight, you could go through the list of product strengths and find those that would trickle down to the end buyer—building your offer on such advantages. If this relationship is vital for your client, they will value such an approach.

In the case mentioned above, I had to dig deeper as it wasn't a straightforward answer. The relationship between my client and their clients was essential, but product strengths were low on the priority list. It was a simple case of vanity. My client just had to have something that would make them different, that would make them look good, even if sacrificing optimal sales. Obviously, they were interested in selling, but in their mind, they already had high sales, and now it was their time to shine.

With this realisation, I proceeded to design an ideal offer, one which would be a win-win case to maximise the value for both sides. The value perception, in this case, was asymmetric. For our side value was money in the bank, and for the other side it was good looks. The client which I advised made a killer, never before seen, margin. Based on the premise that their client valued something that they took for granted. They valued it more than standard industry volume discounts and whatnot.

We sold them a bespoke product with their name printed on it. We made them an irresistible offer.

This change cost my client peanuts while in return, their client got immense emotional value. Incorporating this into the pricing model would allow repeatability and consistent value capture.
