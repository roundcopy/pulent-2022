Culture is a weird beast.

The heterogeneity of culture is the ultimate antifragility property in organisations.

Fostering cultural differences, inclusivity, and enabling variety make the organisation stronger, more resilient and innovative. Culture supports growth.

But at the price of efficiency.

Strong homogenous culture is more efficient. But it brings out fragilities while inhibiting innovation.

Culture is a trade-off.

Homogenous vs heterogeneous culture is a tension. A choice worth debating and challenging.
