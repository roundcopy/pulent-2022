Writing a book can be an overwhelming task, but I discovered a unique approach to overcoming the challenges and successfully completing my book using AI technology. In this article, I'll share my detailed process and the steps I took to transform my initial disorganized ideas into a well-structured and coherent book.

**Key Highlights**:

1. **AI's transformative role in writing**: Leveraging AI tools, specifically the [GPT 3.5 turbo 16K](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) model and [Anthropic AI's Claude 2](https://claude.ai/), I was able to produce a significant volume of content in a limited timeframe.
2. **Learning from mistakes**: My initial writing process was inefficient and aimless. Shifting to a structured AI-supported approach and allowing for "ugly" first drafts greatly improves productivity.
3. **The power of collaboration**: Combining the strengths of AI and human expertise, I was able to create a compelling and cohesive book, complete with a detailed outline, structured chapters, and real-world examples.

## Initiation

A few years ago, during my vacation, I had set a goal to **dedicate at least 30 minutes every night to write**. I sat in front of my computer and poured my thoughts onto the screen, resulting in an accumulation of **20,000 words** over a span of three to four weeks. 

However, after several weeks of writing, I realized that the content I had produced lacked coherence and direction, making it challenging to transform it into a book. Sadly, this initial attempt led to my project being put on hold indefinitely.

> "Realizing that I needed a more structured approach to my writing, I began using folder structure with Markdown files to create an organized framework."

## Discovering the Power of Structure

To further develop my book, I compiled all the relevant details into a **concept file**. This comprehensive document provided a deep understanding of the book's subject matter and its intended audience. 

> "I prepared a concept file encompassing all the essential details, such as the book's title, subtitle, **target audience, problems, pains, needs, and gains**."

Next, I crafted a detailed outline resembling a table of contents, meticulously arranging chapters and sub-chapters in the most compelling way possible.

To improve my approach, I turned to using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to structure my content. I divided it into chapters and sub-chapters, allowing me to create separate files for each sub-subject.

## Learning from Mistakes

One significant lesson I learned from my previous failed attempt was the importance of avoiding over-editing during the writing process. Instead, I began by outlining the book in detail, including a table of contents with structured chapters. For each sub-chapter, I would write a few words as ideas developed. Rather than writing linearly and going back to constantly revise, I focused on getting my initial ideas down, embracing imperfection, and avoiding over-editing.

> "In the words of Hemingway, "Write drunk, edit sober." Even the "ugly" first draft could have significant value."

## Harnessing the Power of AI

Here comes the turning point in my writing process—integrating AI tools. 

Firstly, I sought an AI editor's advice, uploading my content to Claude 2, a powerful AI editing tool with a 100k token context window. The feedback I received from [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) acted as a catalyst, re-igniting my motivation to continue with my book project.

The AI provided detailed feedback comparable to that of an experienced editor specializing in non-fiction and scientific research writing.

> "It was like a spark igniting a firework; suddenly, the idea of completing and publishing the book seemed within reach."

## Implementing AI Feedback

With the AI's comments and criticisms in hand, I embarked on the next stage of **rewriting and restructuring the book**. I revised the outline to make it fresher and more in tune with my target audience.

> "The aim was to lead the reader seamlessly from beginning to end, ensuring their engagement throughout."

Thrilled with the results, now I have integrated GPT 3.5-turbo, into my writing process, leveraging its flexibility through [Better Chat GPT](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT) interface.

Crafting a system prompt became crucial.

`Your name is GhostWriterGPT (Ghostwriting GPT), an AI inspired by Ernest Hemingway's brevity, Malcolm Gladwell's storytelling, and Philip Ball's research depth. Extend the text provided by the user by applying writing strategies to improve clarity, fluency, and brevity. Follow the given rules strictly:`

1. `Use clear and concise language: Avoid jargon, slang, and complex words. Stick to simple and straightforward terms understandable by your target audience.`
2. `Use active voice: Make your writing direct and easy to understand. For example, use "The researcher designed the system" instead of "The system was designed by the researcher."`
3. `Use parallelism: Employ similar grammatical structures for related ideas to create balance and enhance readability.`
4. `Use consistent terminology: Select specific terms for concepts and maintain consistency throughout to avoid confusion.`
5. `Use short sentences: Long sentences can be hard to follow. Aim for an average sentence length of 20 words or less.`
6. `Avoid nominalizations: Use verbs instead of nouns derived from them to simplify your writing. For example, "decide" instead of "decision-making."`
7. `Use appropriate punctuation: Proper punctuation clarifies meaning and enhances readability.`
8. `Use bullet points and lists: Break down complex information into accessible lists.`
9. `Use headings and subheadings: Organize content and guide readers through the document.`
10. `Emphasize important information: Use bold or italic formatting sparingly to draw attention to key points while maintaining readability.`
11. `Write in a logical order: Organize content logically by following a clear sequence, whether general to specific, chronological, or procedural.`
12. `Avoid ambiguity: Use specific and precise language, avoiding vague pronouns without clear antecedents.`
13. `Edit and revise: Thoroughly review your writing to eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and awkward phrasings. `
14. `Write using Markdown.`

`Apply these rules to the following text: [insert text here]`

To improve the initial drafts, I relied on my existing written content, the book's outline, and my intentions, providing GPT 3.5 with a rich dataset to enhance its assistance.

## Fine-tuning the Process

Entering a dedicated session with GPT, I selected the appropriate model, adjusted the temperature slightly to 1.2, and began pasting in each sub-chapter, waiting for GPT to generate acceptable output.

> "After several attempts, I obtained coherent and relevant responses ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 words, perfectly suitable for inclusion in the book."

## The Final Push

Finally, I assembled the various segments, including the newly generated content, into a single markdown file. The accumulated word count had now reached an impressive **40,000 words**.

> "I acknowledge the importance of editing, proofreading, and seeking input from others. To accomplish this, I enlisted the aid of an editor, a proofreader, and a virtual assistant."

## Looking Forward

For the coming months, I anticipate at least 100 hours of work to prepare the book for the new academic year. The book primarily targets **young researchers**, drawing from my extensive 30-year tenure in academia and my experience managing €34 million worth of projects.

> "The journey thus far has been engrossing, and I can't wait to see what my virtual assistant will bring to the table."

This detailed account of my book-writing process showcases the immense potential of leveraging AI and other powerful tools. Whether you aspire to write a book, create engaging articles, or establish a meaningful online presence, remember: with the right balance of human expertise and AI assistance, your potential is limitless.
