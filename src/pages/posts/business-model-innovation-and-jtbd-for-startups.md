## Unable to differentiate in a crowded market

In a crowded market, it can be challenging for startups to differentiate themselves from their competitors and attract customers. 

However, by leveraging the power of business model innovation and JTBD, startups can gain a significant advantage and set themselves apart.

By focusing on the customer's problem instead of the features of the product, startups can better understand what motivates people to buy their products or services. This understanding can then be used to drive business model innovation and create new growth opportunities.
