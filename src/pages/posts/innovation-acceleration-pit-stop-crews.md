A decade in technology transfer in a transition country still leaves a lot to be desired, or all to be desired. The only change is that TT is no longer a buzzword which when used in your proposal or during a posh lunch would make you instantly uber-cool. Today we are all getting excited by digital transformation, green transitions and whatnot. Time has passed.

What happened? It probably was a too big bite for the majority. To be honest, it is not an easy job. So why bother after the grant money runs out. Institutions have trouble covering the operational expenses how can they develop the competencies and team needed to do the TT. Also, the lifecycle of any TT opportunity is much longer than typical political cycles. So it is guaranteed that you will be repeating yourself constantly, and without much result. It is much easier to jump on the next keyword and ride it.

At the same time, all over Europe, a lot of investment is happening. Researchers and companies are innovating and creative solutions are flowing, mostly freely, between various entities. This week I had the pleasure of advising two companies, one from Denmark and the other from France. Both are developing state of art solutions, from mRNA treatments to advanced climate prediction models. I had really enjoyed this opportunity to exercise my IP brain muscles. In both cases, the uncertainty of future prospects and lack of capacity for a comprehensive commercialisation feat was clear.

What is obvious, if Europe really wants to be at the forefront of innovation and growth, we need to do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers. It is not enough to regulate the need for protection and commercialisation when handing out money. We need to maximise business opportunities. We need innovation acceleration pit stop crews. Top professionals versed both in business and innovation as well as communication and customer empathy. Professionals at crossroads. Professionals that can quickly jump to secure new tires and increase traction, check the engine, add fuel and refresh the driver. 

But at one point we have somehow convinced ourselves that we don't need them, and that market can serve itself.
