A decade in technology transfer (TT) in a transition country still leaves much desired. 

The only change I have observed is that TT is no longer a buzzword that would make you instantly cool when used in your grant proposal or during a posh brunch. 

Today we are all excited by digital transformation, green transitions and whatnot. For the times, they are a-changin'.

What happened? It probably was too big a bite for the majority. To be honest, it is not an easy job. 

So why bother after the grant money runs out? 

Institutions have trouble covering operational expenses. How can they develop the competencies and team needed to do the TT? 

Also, the lifecycle of any TT opportunity is much longer than typical political cycles. So it is guaranteed that you will repeat yourself constantly, without much result. It is much easier to jump on the next buzzword and ride it.

At the same time, a lot of investment is happening all over Europe. Researchers and companies are innovating, and creative solutions flow, mostly freely, between various entities. 

This week I had the pleasure of advising two companies, one from Denmark and the other from France. Both develop state-of-the-art solutions, from mRNA treatments to advanced climate prediction models. I really enjoyed this opportunity to exercise my IP brain muscles. In both cases, the uncertainty of future prospects and lack of capacity for a comprehensive commercialisation feat was apparent.

If Europe wants to be at the forefront of innovation and growth, we must do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers. 

When handing out money, it is not enough to regulate the need for protection and commercialisation. We need to maximise business opportunities. 

We need innovation acceleration pit stop crews. 

Top professionals versed in business and innovation, communication, and customer empathy. Professionals at crossroads. Professionals that can quickly jump to secure new tires and increase traction, check the engine, add fuel and refresh the driver. 

But at one point, we have somehow convinced ourselves that we don't need them and that market can serve itself.
