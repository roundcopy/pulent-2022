As defined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, antifragility is a property of a system to not only resist but to thrive in extraordinary circumstances. To thrive in times of hardship. This concept is also connected to the black swan idea as he has coined it in his book of the same name. A black swan is an event that follows three criteria 1. unforeseen, unpredictable event, 2. of great importance, disturbance, 3. tends to be rationalized in hindsight.

Applying and broadening these concepts in the ecosystem of universities and considering it both in local and networked surroundings should be a worthy investment.

Universities' landscape is changing every day and is expected to drastically restructure in the following decades. This is even obvious to the EC which has initiated and invested in the European Universities Initiative to overcome the pressures of the global connected world on European universities.

Considering the massive impact of the internet in recent decades we have seen significant reorientation of leading universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford to online environments. They have heavily invested in developing MOOCs and blended learning programs.

In the time of COVID, this has been more prominent as even the smallest education institutions are now forced to dabble with online tools to deliver learnings that were prepared for in face knowledge transfer resulting in clumsy experiences for students.

The same things are happening in research, especially in those fields which are already by their nature digitalized, but also we are seeing more traditional research done almost exclusively remotely such as astrophysics, social sciences, etc.

Universities are observed through the triangle perspective and it is expected from them to live in three dimensions of education, research, and commercialization or applied research. While recently we are seeing reorientation to include additional dimensions of the environment and society giving them a more relevant context and more long term vision. Transforming the triangle to a prism or a quintuple helix. Universities should be thought of as shapers of the future.

Making universities more interconnected should make them inherently more antifragile. Making them more responsible should make them more perceptive of their surrounding. But we need also to consider each dimension as a separate system and approach the antifragility in each of the aspects starting with the first mission of education.

Developing blended and hybrid learning environments should provide a wider platform for action and reaction. Making students more involved and interconnected should prove helpful in this sense, making them more responsible.

Making the research more digitalized and remotized should provide redundancies and options for access and use. Cooperation with the business sector should be robust enough, but we are having significant challenges, and working more intensively in connecting these efforts with education and research inputs and outputs should provide the needed antifragility but at the same time could increase fragility if not managed mindfully.

Involving society through the engagement of citizens and exposing them to both education and research with life long learning or citizen science, and the third mission with leading them towards more entrepreneurial activities could provide needed interaction which could be a basis for antifragility. The environment is a tough one, but strategically focusing research towards the benefiting environment should at least give as insights in the future.

In 2 million EUR Horizon 2020 project just selected for financing and lead by "European university of the seas" alliance, I have designed a work package to tackle the antifragility of universities. Right now I don't have any answers but we are planning to find them or at least to find and ask the right questions. The core activities are to start the antifragility think-tank to work on this in continuity, to explore opportunities for digitalization and remotization especially of research infrastructure, and to consider the environmental footprint of research practices while also working on a system for transferring soft skills between the researches and working on their development and increase of human capital.

Antifragility is a challenging concept and it is sometimes hard to grasp but can be a useful mental model when thinking about the future of universities. Even if we don't approach the antifragility ideal.
