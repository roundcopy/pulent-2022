As defined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, antifragility is a property of a system to not only resist but to thrive in extraordinary circumstances. 

To thrive in times of hardship. 

## Black swan

This is connected to the black swan concept as he has coined it. A black swan is an event that follows three criteria 1. unforeseen, unpredictable event, 2. of great importance, disturbance, and 3. tends to be rationalized in hindsight.

Applying and broadening these ideas in the university ecosystem and considering them both in local and networked surroundings should be a worthy effort.

## Universities disrupted

Universities' landscape is disrupted daily and is expected to drastically restructure in the following decades. 

This is clear to the EC, which has initiated and invested in the European Universities Initiative to overcome the pressures of the global connected world on European universities.

Considering the massive impact of the internet in recent decades, we have seen significant reorientation of leading universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford to online environments. They have heavily invested in developing MOOCs and blended learning programs.

In the time of COVID, this has been more prominent as even the most traditional educational institutions were forced to do their best with online tools to deliver learning. Often, this resulted in an inelegant experience for everyone.

## Digitalising research processes

The same things are happening in research, especially in those fields which are already, by their nature, digital. At the same time, we see more traditional research done remotely, such as in astrophysics, social sciences, and others.

## The quintuple mission of universities

Universities are observed through the triple mission perspective and are expected to live in three dimensions: education, research, and applied research. 

While recently, we have seen a transformation to include additional dimensions of the environment and society, giving them a more relevant context and long-term vision. Transforming the triangle to a pentangle or, adding a time dimension, to a quintuple helix. 

Universities should be active shapers of the future.

Making universities more interconnected should make them inherently more antifragile. Making them more responsible should make them more perceptive of their surrounding. 

## University dimensions

But we also need to consider each dimension as a separate system and approach the antifragility in each aspect, starting with education as the first and oldest mission.

Developing blended and hybrid learning environments should provide a more expansive scaffold for action and reaction. 

Making students more involved and connected. Making students more responsible. Making them owners of their own learning.

Making the research more digitalized and remotized should provide redundancies and options for easier access and use. 

Cooperation with the business sector should be vigorous, but we have significant challenges. Working more intensively in connecting the efforts with education and research should increase the needed antifragility. At the same time, it could also increase fragility if not managed.

Involving broader society through direct engagement. Exposing them to education and research through lifelong learning, citizen science or something else. It could provide needed interactions as a basis for antifragility. 

The environment is demanding, but strategically focusing research on the benefiting environment should give insights into the future.

## reSEArch-EU

In the 2 million EUR Horizon 2020 project led by the "European university of the seas" alliance, I have designed a work package to tackle the antifragility of universities. 

Right now, there are no answers, not even whole questions.

We are planning to outline the right questions and maybe get some answers. The core idea is to institute the Antifragility Think-Tank to work freely and openly on this. 

To explore opportunities for digitalization and remotization, especially of research infrastructure, to consider the environmental footprint of research practices, and to develop a system for transferring soft skills among the researchers.

## Challenging concept to grasp

Antifragility is not a natural way of thinking for us humans.

But it can be a useful mental model for considering the future of universities. 

Even if we don't reach the antifragility ideal.
