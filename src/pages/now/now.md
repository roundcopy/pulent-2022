## **What rabbit hole I am currently in?**

I am currently spending OpenAI API money like crazy. LLM's are total fun.

## **What I am currently reading?**

Currently I have been reading Altered Carbon. I have finished reading the book series "Dust" written by Hugh Howey. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world where people live in underground silos to escape the harsh surface world. The story follows the lives of the inhabitants and their struggles to survive and thrive. Talking about perfect timing, as Apple just released the TV series.

## **What am I doing to boost my energy?**

I just completed my first semester as an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Natural Science's new Data Science program. I had the opportunity to teach the course on Complex Network Analysis, and working with the students was truly invigorating.

## **Why am I doing a PhD on Digital Transformation?**

I am too old for this. It sounded great at one point. I am pushing through the second year of PhD at the University of Split. Currently struggling with getting published.
