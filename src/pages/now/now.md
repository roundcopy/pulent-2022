##### Q. Why am I doing a PhD on Digital Transformation?

Honestly, no idea. I am too old for this. But it sounded great at one point. I am currently enrolled in a second year of my PhD at the University of Split. Currently waiting for 3 articles to get published, and one in conference proceedings book by Springer.

##### Q. What I am currently reading?

Currently I have been reading Altered Carbon. I have finished reading the book series "Dust" written by Hugh Howey. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world where people live in underground silos to escape the harsh surface world. The story follows the lives of the inhabitants and their struggles to survive and thrive. Talking about perfect timing, as Apple just released the TV series.

##### Q. What am I currently engaged in?

I am currently spending OpenAI API money like crazy. LLM's are total fun and can deliver a lot. I have finished doing secret consultancy work for the World Bank. I am unable to disclose the specific areas or projects I am working on, as it is confidential. ü§ê

##### Q. What am I eagerly awaiting?

I finished my first semester as an assistant lecturer in the new Data Science program at the Faculty of Natural Science, specifically in the course on Complex Network Analysis.
