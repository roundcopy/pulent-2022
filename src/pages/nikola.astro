            <p class="mt-6 text-gray-600">As a curious generalist by nature, I wear many hats. I've been around, seen things. With over 14 years of experience working at the intersection of research and industry, I know the ropes. I'm a pro at research enablement, business support, and innovation management. I've been advisor to the management of swiss fintech startup <a href="https://numarics.com/" target="_blank">Numarics</a> and currently serve as the growth lead at cloud development environments pioneer <a href="https://codeanywhere.com/" target="_blank">Codeanywhere</a>.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">I've helped companies grow, created successful new products, pricing strategies, and inbound campaigns. I'm a mentor to startups, a judge at startup events, EU project evaluator, and project manager on projects with a cumulative value over 34 million EUR. I was European IP Helpdesk ambassador.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">I'm working to build innovation systems and support entrepreneurial and innovative researchers and companies. In short, I'm a master of growth and innovation.</p>
