My dear sons,

There's an artist, [Banksy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy), known for his wit and wisdom sprayed on city walls.

He once said, "If you are tired, learn to rest, not quit."

Life, like a marathon, isn't run at a sprint. It's a balance of strides and pauses. 

Fatigue is a signal, not a stop sign. Rest, don't retire. 

Savor the pit stops – they're the secret sauce of endurance. 

So, learn to rest, my sons, but never quit. 

Embrace the pause, 
Dad.
