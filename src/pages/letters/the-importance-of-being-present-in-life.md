My dear sons,

Being present in the moment is key to success in life. It's important to be aware of your surroundings, to tune your radars, and to follow every blip on it. This will help you orient yourself, communicate effectively, and save time and effort in redundant learnings.

In order to be truly present, you must learn to slow down and appreciate the details around you. Take the time to notice the small things, and pay attention to your intuition. By doing so, you'll be able to make better decisions and navigate through life with ease.

So, stay present in the moment, keep your eyes open for details, and tune your radars to every blip. This will help you find success in whatever you do.

Love, Dad.
