My dear sons,

A year, like a swift bird, often seems to fly past us. 

Yet, a day, this curious creature, never seems to take flight. 

Isn't it peculiar? Time's a funny fellow, isn't he? 

So, remember this paradox of life. 

Savor each day, but also cherish the fleeting beauty of a year. 

After all, it's the daily grind that fills the year's flight with meaning. 

A race won in steps, not leaps. 

Here's to the daily small victories, my lads.

Forever in your corner, 
Dad.
