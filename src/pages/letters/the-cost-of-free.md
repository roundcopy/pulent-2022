My dear sons,

Remember this: "free" is a myth, a paradox of modern times.

Everything that's tagged "free" has a price, paid by someone, somewhere.

Like a backstage worker ensuring the show runs smoothly, someone always foots the bill.

So, appreciate the unseen labor that gifts us the "free" things.

And when you're the one paying, understand the value you're offering to others.

In this world, there's no free lunch, but there's always a chef in the kitchen.

With love and lessons,
Dad
