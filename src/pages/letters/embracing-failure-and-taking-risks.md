My dear sons,

If you fear failing, you will never succeed. So, always act on your dreams and be ready to crash and burn. Success requires taking risks and being willing to fail. It's not about never falling down, but always getting back up and trying again.

Remember, the road to success is never easy, and it's full of ups and downs. But with every failure comes an opportunity to learn and grow. Embrace your failures, and use them to propel yourself forward.

So don't be afraid to take risks, to act on your dreams, and to crash and burn. Because in doing so, you'll learn valuable lessons, gain experience, and ultimately find success.

Love, Dad.
