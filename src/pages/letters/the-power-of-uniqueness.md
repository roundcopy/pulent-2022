My dear sons,

Your DNA is a testament to your uniqueness. Not a shred of it has ever appeared before, nor will it ever again. 

Your experiences? Equally one-of-a-kind. The laughter shared with your brother, your mother's comforting hugs, our late-night talks about life...these are brushstrokes on the canvas of your uniqueness.

This is your power source. Your secret weapon. It's like owning a vinyl record that's been pressed only once, or a book with just one copy. 

Remember, you are not a photocopy in a world of originals, but the masterpiece itself. 

Build from there, my sons. Use the bricks of your unique experiences to construct a life that's authentically, undeniably yours.

With faith in your uniqueness,
Dad.
