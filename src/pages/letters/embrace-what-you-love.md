My dear sons,

Your preferences, passions, and pursuits aren't arbitrary. They're the threads that weave the tapestry of your character.

You are not what you own, your accolades, or your Instagram likes. You are what you love.

Your love for art makes you an artist. Your love for numbers makes you a mathematician. Your love for helping others makes you a humanitarian.

Love is the compass that guides you through the labyrinth of life. It paints your world in vivid colors and composes your life's symphony.

So, my sons, dance to the beat of your heart. Embrace what you love, for it is the essence of who you are.

With all my love,
Dad
