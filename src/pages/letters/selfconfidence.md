My dear sons,

We all have unique skills, talents, and abilities. And it's important to never presume that others are more skilled than you are.

Give others the opportunity to prove themselves. Let them show you what they can do. And remember, you never know what someone is capable of until you give them a chance.

But at the same time, don't underestimate your own skills and abilities. You have so much to offer, and you should never presume that others are more talented or capable than you are.

So be confident in your abilities, be humble in your approach, and always give others the chance to shine. And most importantly, never presume.

Love, Dad.
