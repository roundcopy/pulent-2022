My dear sons,

Remember, life isn't an encyclopedia to be studied cover to cover.

It's a symphony, where a single, perfectly timed note can resonate louder than a cacophony.

Your wisdom isn't measured by knowing all the words, but by knowing the right word to say at the right moment.

So, be smart, not comprehensive. A timely whisper can echo more powerfully than a thoughtless shout.

Choose your moments, choose your words, make them count.

In wisdom and love,
Dad.
