My dear sons,

"The true method of knowledge is experiment," once declared poet William Blake. His words, while centuries old, still ring true.

Life, my lads, is a grand experiment. It's not a Sudoku puzzle where every box has a predetermined number.

It's more like a jazz session - you improvise, harmonize, and sometimes, hit a wrong note. But that's the beauty of it all. 

Embrace the trials, the errors, the glorious victories, and the momentous failures. They are the true teachers in this university of existence.

So, don your lab coats, fasten your safety goggles, be ready to get your hands dirty. This world is your laboratory, and you are the mad scientists.

Carry on experimenting,
Dad.
