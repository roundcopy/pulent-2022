My dear sons,

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication," da Vinci once said. 

Remember, complexity can often be a veil for confusion, while simplicity reveals the essence of things. 

Strive to convey your thoughts simply, for clarity is the true testament of understanding. 

Simplicity in your actions can lead to a life of uncluttered joy and peace. 

Simplicity in possessions can free you from the shackles of materialism.

Above all, simplicity in relationships can foster authenticity and deep connection. 

So, my sons, champion simplicity. It's the most sophisticated move you can make. 

With love,
Dad
