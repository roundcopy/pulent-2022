My dear sons,

The world is constantly changing and it's important to adapt to new channels and means of communication. This is where the power of reuse comes in.

When you create something, always think about how you can reuse it in different ways. For example, Douglas Adams re-purposed his "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" story from a radio show to a TV show to a movie and more. This allowed him to reach a wider audience and multiply the benefits of his work.

So always look for opportunities to reuse your ideas and creations. You never know what new channels and opportunities may arise, but if you plan for reuse, you'll be ready to take advantage of them.

Think big and never stop creating. The possibilities are endless.

Love, Dad.
