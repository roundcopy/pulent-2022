Dear sons,

There's wisdom in Tupac's words, "Don't sit at a table where they talk about others, because when you get up, you're the next topic."

Don't get me wrong. Tables are great. They're for dinners, not for dinners served cold with gossip garnish.

If the table's feast is a dish of others' lives, leave. You're not a critic at a talk-show.

Your friends aren't your friends if they need others' stories to bond. Remember, a good friendship is like a good book. It's about quality, not quantity.

Choose your table wisely, my sons. Make sure it's a table where you can leave your plate unattended.

With all my love,
Dad
