My dear sons,

In the grand arena of life, criticism is a boomerang - it's a reflection of the thrower more than the target.

Before you level criticism at someone's work, ensure it stems from a place of constructive intent.

Remember, it's easy to critique, but to create? That's a beast of a different color.

Someone might be treading water, their spirit buoyed by the very work you're about to critique.

So, tread with care. Throw the boomerang of criticism wisely and with respect for the effort that was put into the work.

Be constructive, not destructive. That's the key.

Stay kind and considerate, 
Dad
