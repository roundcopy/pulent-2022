My dear sons,

Ideas, much like migrating birds, have a life of their own. They are destined to take flight, and if you don't give them wings, they'll find someone who will.

Don't mistake this for theft or coincidence. It's simply the universe's way of saying, "This idea's time has come."

So when you conceive an idea that sparks excitement within you, don't let it linger in your mind. Act. Give it form, color, and life.

Remember, ideas don't belong to us. We are merely their carriers, blessed with the opportunity to bring them to life.

Therefore, be the artist who gives wings to ideas, not the one watching them fly away.

Yours in creativity,\
Dad
