My dear sons,

The art of storytelling is like a magic trick. A good magician doesn't just pull a rabbit out of a hat, he creates a spectacle. 

Likewise, in a story, the context is the spectacle. It sets the stage, it builds suspense, it draws in the audience. But the true magic lies in those precious moments where the idea is revealed.

So, as you speak, write, and live, remember: set the stage, but never forget the rabbit.

With love,
Dad
