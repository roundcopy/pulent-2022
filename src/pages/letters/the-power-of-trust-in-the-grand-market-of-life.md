My dear sons,

Every conversation, every interaction, is a sale of sorts. You're either selling an idea, a perspective, a dream, or a pair of socks.

Hype may bring the crowd, with its loud drums, blazing lights, and grand promises. But remember, hype's magic wears off, much like the fizz in a newly opened soda.

Trust, on the other hand, is the quiet, steadfast force that endures. It builds relationships, fosters loyalty, and is the bedrock for repeat transactions.

So, my sons, while you may employ hype to make the initial sale, strive to cultivate trust. It's the secret sauce for any long-lasting relationship, and indeed, the real deal in the grand market of life.

To a future built on trust, 
Dad.
