My dear sons,

Working hard is commendable, but working smart is the secret sauce. 

Hard work, like a wind-up toy, can run in circles without making progress. Smart work, however, is the compass that gives direction to efforts. 

It's not about evading hard work, it's about utilizing time and resources efficiently. Don't just run up the escalators, figure out which ones are going up. 

Remember, a busy day doesn't always equate to a productive one. 

Work smart, my sons, and you'll find that the hard work you put forth is exponentially more effective.

With love and wisdom,
Dad
