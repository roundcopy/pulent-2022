My dear sons,

Progress always beats perfection. Don't let the fear of not being perfect hold you back from making progress. It's important to have high standards and strive for excellence, but remember, progress is more important than being perfect.

Put your heart into the work you're doing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. The more you do, the better you'll become, and the closer you'll get to your goal.

However, it's also important to be aware of your expectations. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, and don't expect everything to come easy. Life is a journey, not a destination, and the journey is just as important as the destination.

So embrace the journey, my sons, and remember that progress beats perfection.

Love, Dad.
