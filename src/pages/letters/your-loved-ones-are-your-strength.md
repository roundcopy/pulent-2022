My dear sons,

The people you surround yourself with have a huge impact on your life. Your loved ones are your strength, and they will support and encourage you in your journey. That's why it's so important to build your core with people who bring love, understanding, and challenge into your life.

And remember to always honor and respect those closest to you. Relationships can be difficult at times, but the love and support of those closest to you is worth it. Your brother is your biggest ally, so cherish your relationship with him and always have each other's back.

So surround yourself with those who bring positivity and love into your life, and watch as your relationships strengthen and grow.

Love, Dad.
