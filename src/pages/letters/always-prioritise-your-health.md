My dear sons,

Your health is your greatest wealth. Both mental and physical health are essential for a fulfilling and happy life. And while both are important, taking care of your physical health is often the first step to good mental health.

So make healthy habits a part of your daily routine. Exercise regularly, eat nutritious food, get enough sleep, and take care of your body. And remember, a healthy body leads to a healthy mind.

And if you ever need help or support, don't hesitate to reach out. Your health and happiness is always a top priority, so make sure to put yourself first.

Love, Dad.
