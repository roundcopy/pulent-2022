My dear sons,

Think in years, but don't lose years thinking. Long-term goals are the roadmaps but overthinking is the roadblock.

Work in days, the smallest possible units of your long-term plans. A grand cathedral is built one stone at a time.

Live in the moment. Life is now, not in the past regrets or future worries. Be here, be now.

In essence, think like a wise man, work like a diligent man, live like a mindful man.

With love,
Dad
