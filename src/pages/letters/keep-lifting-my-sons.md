My dear sons,

You know, life's a bit like lifting weights. The first time you try, the weight feels heavy, almost insurmountable. It's tough, even painful.

But each day, you lift. And each day, the weight doesn't get lighter. Quite the contrary, you add more.

Yet, you find that you're getting better at it. The same weight doesn't drag you down as much. You're stronger, more resilient. 

Remember, life doesn't get easier. You just get better at handling it. So keep lifting, my sons.

Proudly,
Dad
