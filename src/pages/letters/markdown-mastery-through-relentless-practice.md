My dear sons,

Bruce Lee famously said he fears not the person who practices 10,000 kicks once, but the one who practices one kick 10,000 times.

Malcolm Gladwell echoes this, noting it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill.

Think of Daido Moriyama and Garry Winogrand, tirelessly creating volumes of work to hone their expert eyes.

Greatness demands dedication.

Focus on one thing and practice it relentlessly.

Persevere through the mundane and tedious, for mastery is born from repetition.

Remember, the road to excellence is paved with consistent effort and unwavering commitment.

So pick your "kick," my sons, and practice it 10,000 times.

You'll be amazed at what you can achieve.

With unwavering faith in your potential,
Dad
