My dear sons,

It's important to strive for excellence, but it's more important to focus on improvement. You don't need to be the best, you just need to be better.

Improve on things that have already proven themselves. Look for ways to make them better, faster, more efficient, or more effective. This is where innovation lies. And remember, innovation is relative. You can innovate on innovation.

So don't be afraid to experiment, try new things, and take risks. And always strive to be better than you were yesterday.

Remember, progress is more important than perfection. So focus on improving and growing, and success will follow.

Love, Dad.
