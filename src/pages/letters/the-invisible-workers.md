My dear sons,

Remember that old adage, "There's no such thing as a free lunch"? 

It carries a wisdom of ages. Nothing comes without a cost, even if it's not immediately apparent.

Every "free" thing you enjoy, someone, somewhere is putting in the work. 

It might be behind the scenes, invisible to your eyes, but it's there. 

Enjoy these gifts, absolutely, but never forget the effort that made them possible. 

Acknowledge, appreciate, and when you can, reciprocate. 

In life's grand theater, we're all both actors and audience. 

So tip your hat, my sons, to the invisible workers of the world. 

Your loving Dad.
