My dear sons,

Remember Duchamp's Fountain? The urinal turned masterpiece? It was no Michelangelo's David, but it was art. 

Not because of its craftsmanship or its aesthetics, but because it bore an idea, a narrative.

What you create, whether a thing, a relationship, or a career, is art when it's imbued with thought, creativity, conviction.

Objects become art when they become vessels for ideas. 

So, my sons, fill your lives with ideas, make each action a thoughtful one, and watch as your life becomes your greatest masterpiece.

Exhilarated for your future,
Dad
