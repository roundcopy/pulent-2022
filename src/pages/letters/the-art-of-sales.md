My dear sons,

In life, you'll need to be able to sell - not just products, but ideas and concepts. The art of sales is an essential skill that will serve you well in every aspect of your life.

Remember that everything you do needs to be sold, and sometimes, it won't be for money. It may be for support, for recognition, or simply for a smile. But regardless of what you're selling, the key is to convince the other side that they need it and want it.

If you can't sell your ideas, all your effort will have gone to waste. So, embrace the art of sales and use it to your advantage. Be confident, be persuasive, and always remember to listen to the other side.

With these skills, you'll be unstoppable and ready to tackle anything life throws your way.

Love, Dad.
