My dear sons,

Life is what you make it. It has no inherent meaning until you give it one. That's why it's important to take an active role in designing your life.

Don't just go through the motions, take control of your life and create a vision for what you want to achieve. Set goals, make plans, and take action to make your dreams a reality.

Remember, you are the captain of your own ship. You have the power to chart your own course and create the life you want.

So don't be afraid to take risks, try new things, and step out of your comfort zone. Life is an adventure, and it's up to you to make the most of it.

Take an active role in designing your life, my sons, and you'll be amazed at what you can achieve.

Love, Dad.
