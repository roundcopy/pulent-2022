My dear sons,

In the wild theater of life, the spotlight often eludes ideas dubbed as crazy, too risky, hard, or complex. Don't be quick to dismiss them. 

Remember, radios were once "magic boxes" and rockets to the moon were "lunacy". 

Every idea, regardless of its nature, is a brainchild waiting to be nurtured. 

Consider them like you'd consider a peculiar dish at a new restaurant - it might just end up being your favorite.

After all, it's often the ideas that initially seem too wild or complex that end up changing the world.

Dive into the unknown,
Dad
