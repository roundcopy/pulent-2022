My dear sons,

In a world that swirls like a Van Gogh painting, your compass is reason. 

Reason can transform chaos into clarity, like a lighthouse in a stormy sea.

Don't be a leaf, blown by the winds of sentiment. 

Be the tree, grounded in logic, bending, but not breaking.

Be like Spock in Star Trek, cool-headed in the face of a Klingon attack.

Or like Jerry Seinfeld, making sense of life's absurdities with humor and wit.

Remember, sons, your mind is a powerful tool. 

Sharpen it with reason, and you'll always find your way.

Onwards, with love,
Dad.
