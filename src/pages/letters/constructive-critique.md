My dear sons,

Before you gear up to toss a critique into someone's creative arena, pause and ponder the whys.

Are you aiming to enlighten or just lighten your own load?

Remember, the artist's canvas is often a reflection of their soul, tender and vulnerable.

Consider the effort, the late nights, the crumpled drafts that came before the final piece.

Don't be the bull in the china shop of someone's creative dreams.

Instead, let your critique be constructive, kind, and above all, needed.

Remember, it's a brave world out there for creators. 

Be constructive, not destructive. That's the key.

Love,
Dad
