My dear sons,

One of the greatest gifts you have is your imagination and creativity. So never stop being a kid and keep the kid within you alive. Be open-minded, and don't let man-made rules constrain you. It's important to be honest with yourself and perceptive to the world around you.

Pay attention to the textures and smells around you, and let them guide your creativity. This will help you stay inspired and always see the world with fresh eyes. And as you grow, your imagination and creativity will continue to guide you in new and exciting directions.

So never lose touch with your inner child, and always keep your imagination and creativity alive.

Love, Dad.
