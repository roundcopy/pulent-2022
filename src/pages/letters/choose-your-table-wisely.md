My dear sons,

As the great Tupac Shakur once said, "Don't sit at a table where they talk about others, because when you get up, you're the next topic."

In life, tables you choose to sit at, matter. Choose tables with conversations that inspire, enlighten, and push boundaries, not ones that belittle, gossip or undermine.

Remember, conversations that breed negativity often turn on their own. Steer clear.

Take the high road, pick the right table, and be the one who lifts others up.

With love and respect,
Dad
