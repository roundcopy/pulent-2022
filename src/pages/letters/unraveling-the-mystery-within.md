My dear sons,

Work isn't always a bed of roses, nor does it have to be your favorite pastime. But within its confines, there's a silver lining. 

It's a quiet stage, where you can unravel yourself, bit by bit, like a mystery novel with infinite chapters. 

Through trials, errors, victories, and setbacks, you will encounter the most elusive character - yourself. 

So, when you're elbows deep in work, remember to pause, look around, and appreciate the chance to meet yourself. 

Love, 
Dad.
