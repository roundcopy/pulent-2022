My sons,

Time, the ultimate landlord, doesn't favor tenants. You can't amass wealth by merely renting out your hours.

Business? Not a skill you can master from textbooks alone.

The real trick? Anticipate what society craves before it even knows. Become the maestro who orchestrates that desire, on a grand scale.

Who brings the unseen to light, profits in delight.

Your conductor's baton awaits,
Dad
