Dear Sons,

Life is full of frustrations and challenges that can sometimes feel overwhelming. But it's important to remember that frustration is not reality. It's simply an escape from reality that can lead us down a path of anger and impulsiveness.

When you feel frustration building inside of you, take a step back, take a breath, and remember the cliff of reality. Don't let your emotions take over and cause you to break against the harsh realities of life.

Instead, focus on finding solutions and facing challenges head-on. You are capable of overcoming any obstacle, but it starts with a clear mind and a level-headed approach.

Remember, frustration is just a feeling, but it doesn't have to define your reality. Keep a clear head and a steady hand, and you'll be able to navigate life's challenges with grace and ease.

With love, Dad
