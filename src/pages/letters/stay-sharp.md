Hey boys,

You know, success is a bit like a ninja. It's 80% awareness. 

You need to know where you are, where you want to be, and the multitude of paths available to you. Realize that opportunities are like sneaky ninjas, too. They often creep up in the most unexpected places, hiding in plain sight.

So, keep your senses sharp. Your eyes wide open. Ears tuned in. Mind alert.

Stay aware, my sons. Success might just be lurking around the corner.

Stay sharp,
Dad
