My dear sons,

Remember Dražen Petrović's wisdom at 16: "Talent can only go so far, effort takes you all the way". 

Talent, like a rocket, can launch you high, but it's the fuel of effort that keeps you soaring. 

Every dribble, every practice shot, every miss, every win: they count. 

It's not about the scoreboard at the end, but the sweat-soaked jersey.

Success, my sons, is the sum of efforts repeated day in and day out. 

So, lace up those shoes, hit the court and keep playing, even if your shots don't always swish. 

Remember, it's not just the talent you're born with, it's the effort you put in. 

With love and belief in your journey,
Dad
