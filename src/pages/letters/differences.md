My dear sons,

Differences make life interesting, they add meaning and depth to our experiences. Without differences, life would be dull and monotonous.

Embrace the differences you encounter in others. Whether it's cultural, linguistic, religious or even just personal preferences. The differences between us are what make the world such a rich and diverse place.

Don't be afraid to explore new things, try new experiences, and meet new people. And remember, if we were all the same, life would not be nearly as exciting or fulfilling.

So embrace your differences and those of others. And remember, differences give us meaning and make life worth living.

Love, Dad.
