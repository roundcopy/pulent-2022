My dear sons,

Aristotle said, "Quality is not an act, it is a habit." The old philosopher knew his salt.

Life's not about grand gestures or one-off feats - it's about consistency.

Quality, like your mother's cooking, isn't a one-time wonder. It's a consistent commitment to excellence.

So, my sons, don't be a firework that shines once and fades. Be the northern star, constant and reliable.

Make quality your habit, not just an act.

Keep shining,
Dad
