My dear sons,

When you decide to do something, commit fully. Dive in. 

This isn't just a quaint principle, it's a secret weapon. Your grandad passed it to me, and now I to you.

When you're "all in," you're not just participating, you're living the experience. You're not just there, you're present.

This is not about obsessing, it's about immersing. It's about knowing your surroundings, understanding your role, and taking responsibility.

So, boys, whatever you choose to do, be all in. 

Blinkers off, senses on. Navigate with purpose, act with intent.

Because being "all in" is not just about doing, it's about being.

Yours lovingly,
Dad
