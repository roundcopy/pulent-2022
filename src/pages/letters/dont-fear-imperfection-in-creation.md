My dear sons,

When it comes to creation, it's important to remember that drafts are just that - drafts. They are not final versions and they don't need to be perfect.

The key to a successful creation is to create fast and without hesitation. Don't get bogged down in the details, just get your ideas down on paper (or screen) as quickly as possible.

Once you have a draft, you can then start editing and polishing. But don't be afraid to make mistakes or to have a messy first draft. That's just part of the process.

So embrace your drafts, embrace the messy creation process, and never be ashamed to start with something that is not perfect. With time and effort, you will turn your drafts into works of art.

Love, Dad.
