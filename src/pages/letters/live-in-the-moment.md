My dear sons,

Consider this: think in years, work in days, live in the moment.

Your grand plans should span years, those are the epic sagas of your life.

Yet, work in days. Each day is a chapter in your saga, make it a page-turner.

However, don't forget to live in the moment. It's the fleeting dialogue, the quick glances, the living breath of your life's narrative.

Remember, the present moment is the only one you truly possess, the past is a ghost story, the future is science fiction.

With love and anticipation for your epic stories,
Dad.
