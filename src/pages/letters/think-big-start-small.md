My dear sons,

Never let the confines of a small box dictate the size of your dreams. 
Remember, the universe didn't start with a bang, but a singularity. 

Every skyscraper started as a blueprint, every forest as a seed, every symphony as a solitary note. 

Think big, but start small. Incremental changes lead to exponential outcomes. 

The world is full of grand ideas waiting to be discovered. Don't shy away from them. 

Remember, my sons, your thoughts shape your world. So, never think too small.

With all the love in the universe,
Dad
