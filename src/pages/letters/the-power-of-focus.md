Dear Sons,

Remember, focus is the art of knowing what to ignore.

You can swim in an ocean of possibilities, each more tantalizing than the last. Yet, focus demands you choose one island and swim towards it, relentlessly, undeterred by the allure of the others.

It's about saying "No" to the siren call of the phenomenal, to honor your commitment to the exceptional.

Focus is the superpower to silence the noise, to see the unseen.

So, embrace the discipline of focus, my sons. For in the pursuit of saying "No," you'll find the most significant "Yes" of all.

With all the love,
Dad.
