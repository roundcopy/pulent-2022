My dear sons,

Even though everything already exists, that's no excuse for not doing it again. 

Life's orchestra plays the same notes but each conductor brings a unique rhythm. 

It's not about creating anything new under the sun, but about bringing your own sunshine. 

Your version of the existing might just be the much-needed remix. 

So, my lads, never shy away from re-inventing, re-imagining, re-doing. 

It's your performance that counts, not the script. 

Play on, and play well,
Dad.
