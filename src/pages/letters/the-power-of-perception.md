My dear sons,

Remember that tale of the Red Baron, the audacious pilot who painted his plane crimson?

He understood the power of perception - your triumphs aren't solely about your performance, but equally about how others perceive it.

Each time he downed an enemy plane, he ordered a trophy from a jeweler, an act of flamboyance that shaped his public image.

So, in your pursuits, remember - success isn't just about the act, but also the art of presentation.

Influence perception, and you'll soar sky-high, just like the Red Baron, with a metaphorical plane as bright as your ambitions.

With love,
Dad.
