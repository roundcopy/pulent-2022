My dear sons,

There's a curious phenomenon in the world of ideas. It's like they have a mind of their own, and when they're ready to be born, they'll find a way.

When an idea sparks in your mind and you let it simmer, don't be surprised if someone else serves it up. It's not a case of intellectual theft; it's simply the idea finding a path to reality.

Ideas, you see, are restless. They have an uncanny knack for seeking out creators, whispering in their ears, and setting their minds ablaze. So, when an idea visits you, don't merely entertain it. Engage with it, nourish it, and let it find its voice through you.

Remember, my sons, ideas are like wild stallions. If you don't saddle them up and ride, they'll find another cowboy.

So, be the cowboy of your ideas,\
Dad
