My dear sons,

One of the most important lessons in life is learning how to make smart choices. And one of the ways to do this is by thinking about the outcome of your choices.

Remember when you told me about the hunting horn and hunting dogs? It's smarter to go for the horn because you can command the dogs, instead of having just one dog.

Always think about the end goal and what you want to achieve. Then, consider your options and choose the one that will bring you the most value.

Remember, the smart choice is not always the simplest one, but it is always the one that will lead you to the added value.

Love, Dad.
