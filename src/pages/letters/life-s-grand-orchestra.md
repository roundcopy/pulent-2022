Dear Filip and Dominik,

Life, in its grand and chaotic orchestra, is essentially all about sales.

Every story you tell, every idea you share, and every dream you reveal is a sale. It's a sale of your thoughts, your beliefs, your passions.

Even that painting you made, my little Van Gogh, is a silent auction of colors and strokes, bidding for attention and admiration.

Your homework is no different. Each completed task is a transaction, a trade-off of effort for knowledge.

Your car, it's not just a vehicle. It's a sales pitch on wheels, selling freedom, adventure, and the promise of new horizons.

All of life is a marketplace, bustling with ideas, dreams, and possibilities. The currency? Awareness.

So, my sons, become master salesmen. Sell your dreams, sell your passions, and sell your ideas. Because if no one knows about them, they might as well be invisible.

In the bazaar of life, remember: It's not about having, it's about selling.

Yours in salesmanship,
Dad
