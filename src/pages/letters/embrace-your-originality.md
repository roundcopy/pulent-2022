My dear sons,

Beware the allure of the carbon-copy existence, the mirage of "cool" that beckons you to blend in with the crowd.

Fitting in is like buying a ticket to a very dull party. 

Remember, originality always trumps imitation. You're not a mime or a parrot, you're a unique masterpiece. 

Don't fear the spotlight of individuality, embrace it! It's the quickest route to self-discovery, authenticity and, yes, coolness. 

The world doesn't need more copies, it craves originals. 

Stay true to you, 
Dad.
