My dear sons,

The world is a bustling symphony, each instrument vying for your attention. Friends, colleagues, even well-meaning teachers will offer their melodies.

But remember, amidst this cacophony, your inner voice hums its own tune.

Don't let the external noise, however sweet or harsh, drown your music. Be the conductor of your life's orchestra.

Remember, it's your uniqueness that makes your music worth listening to. 

So, my sons, tune into the whispers of your soul. Refine the notes, adjust the tempo, and craft your masterpiece.

Your symphony awaits,
Dad.
