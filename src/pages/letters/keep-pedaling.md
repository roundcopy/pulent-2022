My dear sons,

Life, as our good friend Einstein once quipped, is a lot like a bicycle. To maintain your balance, you must keep pedaling forward. 

Now, bicycles don't have rearview mirrors, and neither does life. So, no matter how much that past ride may have winded you, keep your eyes on the road ahead. 

Remember, every hill you climb strengthens your legs for the next one. So pedal hard, relish the breeze, and enjoy the journey. 

Onward and upward,
Dad.
