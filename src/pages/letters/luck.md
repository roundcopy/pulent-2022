Dear Sons,

Luck is not just something that happens to you, it's something you create. The more open and present you are, the more opportunities you'll be able to recognize and take advantage of.

Think about it like this, luck is like a sunbeam that shines down on you, but it's up to you to open your arms and embrace it. The more you do, the more you'll be able to multiply your luck.

It's all about being in the right place at the right time, and recognizing when that moment has arrived. So keep your eyes and mind open, be proactive, and take calculated risks. The more you do, the luckier you'll become.

Remember, life is a journey and you are the creator of your own luck. So embrace the opportunities that come your way and make the most of them.

Wishing you all the luck in the world,
Dad.
