Hey there, my future Einsteins,

Choose wisely who you let into your orbit. You see, we're a bit like chameleons, adopting the colors, moods, and habits of those around us. 

So, choose the bright, the bold, the ambitious. Surround yourself with those who challenge you, who push you, who make you laugh until tears stream down your face.

Because, my sons, you become a cocktail of the characters you keep close. 

In the grand symphony of life, ensure your orchestra enriches your melody, not drowns it.

Choose wisely. Choose brilliantly.

With all my love,
Dad
