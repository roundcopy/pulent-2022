My dear sons,

Success is a journey, not a destination. And the first step to success is simply showing up.

It doesn't matter if you're not ready, if you're not feeling confident, or if you're not sure what to do. The most important thing is to show up and start. Because once you're there, you can start making progress, taking action, and learning from your experiences.

So always show up, my sons, even when it's difficult or uncomfortable. And remember, success is a journey, not a destination. So enjoy the process, embrace the challenges, and never give up.

Love, Dad.
