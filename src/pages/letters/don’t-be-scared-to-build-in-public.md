My dear sons,

Building in public can be scary, but it's also a valuable and effective way to grow. When you build in public, you open yourself up to feedback from others. This can help you avoid mistakes, iterate faster, and align your work more closely with your final audience.

And as you build in public, you'll also establish yourself as an expert and promote your work. So don't be afraid to put yourself out there. The benefits of building in public far outweigh the risks.

And remember, it's always important to be authentic and true to yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not, just be the best version of yourself.

Love, Dad.
