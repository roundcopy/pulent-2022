My dear sons,

Remember, when something's free, you might be the product. 

Like a free buffet where they're fattening the geese.

Online platforms giving away services? They're not Santa. They're swapping your data for dollar signs.

Keep your eyes open, your wits sharp. 

Enjoy the freebies, but don't be the turkey.

Stay vigilant,

Dad.
