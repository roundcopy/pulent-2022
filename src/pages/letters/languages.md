My dear sons,

Learning languages is like having a superpower in life. The earlier you start, the more fluent you become. Don't just stop at one, aim to learn as many as you can. It's like having multiple keys to unlock different doors of opportunities.

Imagine being able to communicate with people from all over the world, to understand their culture and to make friends that can last a lifetime. And trust me, when you get older, you will have plenty of other things to spend your time on, so why not make the most of it now?

Think of it this way, every language you learn is like a tool in your toolbox, and the more tools you have, the more prepared you are to tackle any challenge.

So my advice to you, my dear sons, is to embrace this opportunity and start learning a new language today. The world is your oyster, and the only limit is your imagination.

Love,
Dad
