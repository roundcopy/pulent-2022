My dear sons,

Life is a gift, and treating every day like it's your birthday is important. Have fun, enjoy the little moments, and celebrate life's joy.

Remember the song by Vojko V? It's a reminder to live fully and enjoy every moment. Take the time to celebrate your accomplishments, and don't be afraid to indulge in what makes you happy.

Life is too short to be serious all the time. So laugh, dance, sing, and celebrate the gift of life. And remember to share that joy with others.

So go ahead, my sons, and live your life like every day is your birthday. Have fun, be happy, and enjoy every moment.

Love, \
Dad.
