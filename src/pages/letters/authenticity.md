My dear sons,

Being cool isn't about the swagger in your stride or the sunglasses perched on your nose. It's not about acting a part or donning a role. 

It's about being genuine, being you. It's as simple and as complex as that. 

You see, "cool" is what happens when you're comfortable in your own skin. When you're not afraid to laugh at your own jokes or sing off-key. 

In the words of Kurt Vonnegut, "We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be". 

So, don't act cool, be cool. Just be yourselves, my sons, and let the world catch up. 

In the grand scheme of things, authenticity trumps pretense. Every time. 

With love and admiration for the cool dudes you are,
Dad.
