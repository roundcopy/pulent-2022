Dear sons,

Choosing your tribe wisely is the most influential decision you can make. 

Remember, you're an average of the five folks you hang out with the most. It's a bit like how a cup of tea absorbs the flavor of a nearby lemon slice. 

Pick those who inspire you, challenge you, make you laugh, and, importantly, who hand you the TV remote on a lazy Sunday. 

Choose wisely, as these are the folks who will shape your character, your sense of humor, even your Netflix recommendations. 

So, my sons, surround yourself with people who help you grow, who make you feel like the best version of yourself. 

After all, who wants to be a bitter lemon when they could be a sweet and spicy chai?

With love and lemon zests,\
Dad
