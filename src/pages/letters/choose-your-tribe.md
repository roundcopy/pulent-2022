My dear sons,

Here's the thing: you're a human, not a chameleon. But, in an interesting twist of biology and sociology, you do tend to mirror those around you.

You see, the folks you hang out with, your "tribe," as I like to call it, are like a buffet of behavioral blueprints. 

Choose wisely, my sons. Your tribe will subtly shape your thoughts, your actions, even your Netflix recommendations. 

Spend time with the wise, and you might just learn a thing or two. Spend time with the kind, and you might just soften your heart. 

So, pick your tribe carefully. Not necessarily those who share your DNA, but those who share your spirit, your ambitions, your values. 

In life's grand party, they're the ones you want to be doing the Electric Slide with. 

Shine on, my boys,\
Dad
