My dear sons,

Life is much like a game of cards. Both involve playing with the hand you’re dealt and watching the signals others emit.

Be mindful of the signals you emit, they’re your neon sign in this bustling world.

Your signals, your words, your actions, your reactions, they all shape perception, yours and others’. They frame our understanding, like a Picasso painting with each stroke revealing more.

Remember, your signals set your market price in this grand exchange of life.

Stay authentic, keep your signals clear and true. Let them reflect who you are and who you aspire to be.

And remember, you are not just the dealer, you are also the player. Learn to read the signals of others, they’re hidden chapters in the book of life.

Be the signal that lights up the world, Dad.
