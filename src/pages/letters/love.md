My dear sons,

Remember that one TV show where the guy used a Swiss Army knife to escape from a maximum-security prison using only a paperclip and a pack of gum? 

Life, my sons, is a bit like that, but replace the prison with challenges, the Swiss Army knife with love, and the gum with tenacity. 

Love, that undeniably powerful tool, can cut through the toughest of knots, uncork the sweetest victories and even pick the lock of your highest ambitions.

So, wield it with courage, my sons. Use it to conquer challenges, to build bridges, to mend hearts and heal wounds. 

Keep it sharp, keep it clean, and most importantly, keep it close.

Because in the end, love, like a Swiss Army knife, can be the key to conquering all.

With all my love,
Dad.
