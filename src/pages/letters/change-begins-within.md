My dear sons,

When I was younger, I aimed to change the world. 

It turned out to be quite a tall order, so I scaled it down to changing my nation. 

That didn't go so well either, so I focused on our town. 

Changing the town was no cakewalk, so I turned my attention to our family. 

In the end, the only thing I could genuinely change was myself. 

Had I realized this sooner, changing myself might have impacted our family. 

Together, we could've influenced our town, which might have rippled out to the nation, ultimately changing the world. 

So, my sons, start with yourselves. 

Small changes within can lead to monumental impacts outside. 

Be the change, and watch how the world transforms around you.

Love,
Dad
