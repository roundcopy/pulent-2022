My dear sons,

I want to remind you of the documentary we watched about Metallica recording their album, St. Anger. It was a struggle, and they went through a lot of pain to create that album. But when you listen to it as a finished product, it sounds perfect.

It's important to remember that no matter how successful someone may be, they're still human. They experience struggles, pain, and difficulties just like anyone else. It's what they do with those struggles that makes them stand out.

Don't idolize people, but respect their work and the effort they put into it. And remember, success is not easy, it takes hard work, perseverance, and dedication.

So don't be afraid of the struggle, my sons. Embrace it, learn from it, and use it as a way to grow and improve.

Love, Dad.
