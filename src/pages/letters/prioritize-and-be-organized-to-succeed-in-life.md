My dear sons,

In life, we learn many lessons from many different sources, but it is important to always be aware of the primary lesson in each situation.

For example, in your education and school experience, the primary lesson is not necessarily the actual subjects being taught, but rather the importance of prioritizing and being organized.

Secondary to that is the actual content being taught. It is important to recognize the value of these secondary lessons, but it is even more important to understand the primary lesson and apply it to your life.

Always keep your priorities straight and be organized. This will help you achieve your goals in life and make the most of your time.

Remember, education is not just about memorizing information, it's about developing important skills that will help you succeed in life.

Love, Dad.
