My spirited sons,

The future, an abstract canvas untamed by brush strokes, is yours to paint.

Change, a peculiar artist, wields an invisible brush. It paints slowly, quietly - so slow, you might mistake its work for a stationary landscape.

But beware, for change has a whimsical way of switching gears. It leaps from a slow waltz to a fervent tango, transforming the canvas before your eyes.

So, keep your eyes wide, your mind alert. Track the slow, subtle strokes, for they prepare you for the sudden whirlwind of color.

And when the sudden change arrives, you’ll be ready to dance along, armed with the rhythm of understanding and the grace of adaptability.

In anticipation of your colorful future,
Dad.
