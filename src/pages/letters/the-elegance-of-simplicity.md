Dear sons,

Da Vinci was on to something. "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

In a world that often applauds complexity, remember the elegance of simplicity.

Is the path tangled? Simplify it. Is the decision knotty? Simplify it.

Simplicity is not about lacking. It's about clarity. It's about purpose. It's about eliminating the unnecessary so the necessary may speak.

Remember, my boys, in simplicity, you find sophistication.

Keep it simple,

Dad.
