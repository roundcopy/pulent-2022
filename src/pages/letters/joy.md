My dear sons,

It's important to find joy and happiness in what you do. But remember, it's more important to enjoy what you do, rather than just doing what you enjoy.

When you enjoy what you do, it's no longer work, it's a passion. It's a joy that will sustain you and bring fulfillment to your life. And when you're fulfilled, you'll find that the joy spills over into other areas of your life.

So look for opportunities to enjoy what you do, my sons. Whether it's your job, your hobbies, or your relationships. Find the joy, and you'll find the happiness.

Love, Dad.
