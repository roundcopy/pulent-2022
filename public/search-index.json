A black swan is an event that follows three criteria 1. unforeseen, unpredictable event, 2. of great importance, disturbance, and 3. tends to be rationalized in hindsight.\n\nApplying and broadening these ideas in the university ecosystem and considering them both in local and networked surroundings should be a worthy effort.\n\n## Universities disrupted\n\nUniversities' landscape is disrupted daily and is expected to drastically restructure in the following decades. \n\nThis is clear to the EC, which has initiated and invested in the European Universities Initiative to overcome the pressures of the global connected world on European universities.\n\nConsidering the massive impact of the internet in recent decades, we have seen significant reorientation of leading universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford to online environments. They have heavily invested in developing MOOCs and blended learning programs.\n\nIn the time of COVID, this has been more prominent as even the most traditional educational institutions were forced to do their best with online tools to deliver learning. Often, this resulted in an inelegant experience for everyone.\n\n## Digitalising research processes\n\nThe same things are happening in research, especially in those fields which are already, by their nature, digital. At the same time, we see more traditional research done remotely, such as in astrophysics, social sciences, and others.\n\n## The quintuple mission of universities\n\nUniversities are observed through the triple mission perspective and are expected to live in three dimensions: education, research, and applied research. \n\nWhile recently, we have seen a transformation to include additional dimensions of the environment and society, giving them a more relevant context and long-term vision. Transforming the triangle to a pentangle or, adding a time dimension, to a quintuple helix. \n\nUniversities should be active shapers of the future.\n\nMaking universities more interconnected should make them inherently more antifragile. Making them more responsible should make them more perceptive of their surrounding. \n\n## University dimensions\n\nBut we also need to consider each dimension as a separate system and approach the antifragility in each aspect, starting with education as the first and oldest mission.\n\nDeveloping blended and hybrid learning environments should provide a more expansive scaffold for action and reaction. \n\nMaking students more involved and connected. Making students more responsible. Making them owners of their own learning.\n\nMaking the research more digitalized and remotized should provide redundancies and options for easier access and use. \n\nCooperation with the business sector should be vigorous, but we have significant challenges. Working more intensively in connecting the efforts with education and research should increase the needed antifragility. At the same time, it could also increase fragility if not managed.\n\nInvolving broader society through direct engagement. Exposing them to education and research through lifelong learning, citizen science or something else. It could provide needed interactions as a basis for antifragility. \n\nThe environment is demanding, but strategically focusing research on the benefiting environment should give insights into the future.\n\n## reSEArch-EU\n\nIn the 2 million EUR Horizon 2020 project led by the \"European university of the seas\" alliance, I have designed a work package to tackle the antifragility of universities. \n\nRight now, there are no answers, not even whole questions.\n\nWe are planning to outline the right questions and maybe get some answers. The core idea is to institute the Antifragility Think-Tank to work freely and openly on this. \n\nTo explore opportunities for digitalization and remotization, especially of research infrastructure, to consider the environmental footprint of research practices, and to develop a system for transferring soft skills among the researchers.\n\n## Challenging concept to grasp\n\nAntifragility is not a natural way of thinking for us humans.\n\nBut it can be a useful mental model for considering the future of universities. \n\nEven if we don't reach the antifragility ideal."},{"slug":"balancing-homogeneity-and-heterogeneity-in-organizational-culture","category":"blog","title":"Balancing Homogeneity and Heterogeneity in Organizational Culture","description":"","tags":["culture"],"body":"Cultural homogeneity is a shared set of values, attitudes, and behaviours within a group or organization.\n\nThis can contribute to increased efficiency and cohesion, but it can also make the group rigid and resistant to change.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural heterogeneity refers to the range of values, beliefs, and behaviours within a group or organization.\n\nThis can promote creativity and resilience but can also lead to conflicts and communication problems.\n\n## The benefits and challenges of both approaches\n\n### Benefits of cultural homogeneity\n\n* Greater efficiency\n* Cohesiveness\n* Clarity of expectations\n\n### Challenges of cultural homogeneity\n\n* Inflexibility\n* Lack of diversity\n* Risk of groupthink\n\n### Benefits of cultural heterogeneity\n\n* Innovation\n* Resilience\n* Inclusivity\n\n### Challenges of cultural heterogeneity\n\n* Communication difficulties\n* Conflict management\n* Lack of cohesiveness\n\n## Finding the sweet spot\n\nOrganizations must strike a balance between cultural homogeneity and heterogeneity.\n\nA homogeneous culture may lack creativity and inclusivity, whereas a varied culture may struggle with communication and cohesiveness.\n\nStriving for a diverse and inclusive culture while keeping clear expectations and a cohesive team can result in a more successful and effective organization.\n\n## Why finding a balance that works for your business is important\n\nOrganizations may discover no one-size-fits-all solution when they attempt to find the correct mix of homogeneity and variability in their culture.\n\nThe advantages of achieving a workable equilibrium for your organization will vary depending on your individual goals, values, and needs.\n\nOrganizations can establish a culture that is both efficient and inventive, cohesive and inclusive, by recognizing and uniting on fundamental principles, supporting diversity and inclusivity, and handling conflicts and communication challenges.\n\n## Figuring out what your organization cares about\n\nFind the right balance between homogeneity and diversity in your organization's culture by determining its most essential values, beliefs, and behaviours.\n\nAll your employees should share these values, beliefs, and behaviours that align with your business's mission and goals.\n\nTo identify your organization's values, beliefs, and behaviours, you can start by asking yourself the following questions:\n\n* What is the purpose of our organization?\n* What are the core principles that guide our actions and decision-making?\n* What are the behaviours that we expect from our employees?\n* How do we want to be perceived by our customers, clients, and stakeholders?\n\nOnce you know your organization's values, beliefs, and behaviours, you can use them to make decisions, evaluate, and bring your culture into line.\n\nFor example, if one of your values is innovation, you might encourage your employees to take risks and think outside the box. You might also reward and recognize employees with new and creative ideas.\n\nBy figuring out and agreeing on your organization's values, beliefs, and behaviours, you can build a strong foundation for your culture and help ensure that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goal.\n\n## Reconciling trade-offs between cultural homogeneity and heterogeneity\n\nCultural homogeneity, in my opinion, relates to the degree to which a group or organization shares the same values, beliefs, and actions. \n\nThis can result in increased efficiency and cohesion, but it can also make the group or organization rigid and resistant to change.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural heterogeneity refers to the range of values, beliefs, and behaviours within a group or organization. \n\nThis can encourage innovation and resilience but can lead to conflicts and communication problems.\n\nIn a nutshell, homogeneity is like a well-oiled machine, but heterogeneity is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you'll get."},{"slug":"business-strategy-and-planning-fueling-growth-in-profitable-saas-companies","category":"blog","title":"Business Strategy and Planning in 2023: Fueling Growth in Profitable SaaS Companies","description":"Learn the key elements of a successful SaaS strategy for your company.

So even if you manage the sales for the first time, you should firstly look for the numbers. You can quickly have answers to drive you and your team toward solid and repeatable results.\n\n### Understanding the context\n\nAt one point I was managing a small team of field representatives. **Selling real physical products was** a refresher but also **a massive challenge** as it involved real **people**, genuine **products** and **customers** spread all over the country. Everything was entirely new, plus I didn't have any previous experience on which I could base my self-confidence.\n\nThe setup that I had inherited was almost non-existent; abandoned manually updated \"MS Access\" **CRM** database and a bunch of private notes from the reps with no real transferable value or supporting context. Sales reps did a daily report which with time turned into truly meaningless musings looking almost the same every day. On the level of _\"She had a great shirt, next time I should ask where she bought it\"_. As much as this can be useful to a good salesman, we were missing a lot of actionable insights.\n\nWe had one weekly email report from the wholesalers as the only relevant sales record. **Everyone nervously waited for the Monday morning** to hear the aggregated number of sales for their territory, and that was it. More with fear did they manage to achieve the weekly target, which was arbitrarily set by the CEO. Targets were a problem in itself as they were fixed values and didn't take into account the growth of sales or any other fundamental specificity such as market size. Moreover, they didn't challenge the sales team to push further.\n\nI have invested some time to talk with each of the representatives and understand all the involved parties. Due to the history of doing things the same way, there was inherent resistance dreading potential disruption. Most of them had arranged their days conveniently with just that weekly target in mind. Some of them had lazy mornings, others loved to joyride, but honestly, they hardly worked their 8 hours. At the same time, due to the lack of central real-time data management, everything was kept in the heads of the reps and the company was in a hostage situation to them. **The change couldn't come out of the blue as it would hit us back in the head 100%.**\n\n### Provide value to your team from the start\n\nOne of the first ideas was to sift through the existing data and try to automate some parts of the process. This would have a twofold benefit, on one side we would have a **better picture of the sales** over several dimensions (buyers, geographies, products, etc.) and on the flip side, we would **provide our reps with feedback on their efforts**. This was a huge leap and value to the reps, which also confer trust, allowing them to see the results of their work.\n\n### Analysing sales with the help of Google Data Studio\n\n![](/images/gds_picture.png)\n\nData Studio from Google allows you to sift through **big data** and design pretty reports to inspire smarter business decisions. As is the case with other Google products, it is simple, yet powerful. It shouldn't take much time to orient around and design the first report. Challenge is elsewhere, how to confidently analyse the data and be sure that your interpretation is correct.\n\n> **TIP** Manual labour is honest. Avoid overkill setups. Do it as simple as you can, even if that means manual copy-pasting at first. When it proves itself, and you find valuable patterns in the process, you will easily find a way to automate it later.\n\nThe sales numbers came in from the third party (wholesaler) in the form of CSV file (comma separated values), so it was relatively easy to get them into [Google Data Studio](http://datastudio.google.com) with the **Google Sheets acting as a proxy**. One colleague in accounting got a new Monday morning task to copy-paste everything from a wholesaler email in a joint sheet while sipping the first coffee. Out of this massive sheet, I have designed 15 different pages in Data Studio each with several charts, **answering typical questions coming from management, sales reps and the production department**.\n\n### Management uptake is critical\n\nFor the first month or two, I have kept this under wraps to be sure that there are no errors that could easily be misused to provide arguments for the \"resistance\". Once I was convinced that everyone understands each page of the report, I have started introductions top-down. With management uptake secured, it was easier to proceed.\n\n### Finding where the sales team is spending their time\n\n![](/images/repsly_pic.png)\n\nOnce we had reports on sales, we were still missing data on the visits and contacts in the field. Two solutions that were simple to use and both ticked many of the marks were [Badger Maps](https://www.badgermapping.com) and [Repsly](https://www.repsly.com/). After some investigation and testing, we selected Repsly. **Repsly made the switch easy with its simplicity and good user experience.** It was intuitive, and our sales reps used it almost instantly with no need for explanations. Having the data at any given moment easily reachable was also happily welcomed by sales. More importantly, it had a useful [API](http://developer.repsly.com/repsly-developers) (Application Programming Interface), which allowed me to export their visits for analysis.\n\nThe prototype was hacked in 5 minutes using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (an automation tool with integrations in 1500+ apps) as it allowed me to connect Sheets and Repsly with just a few clicks. It was an instant success. **For the first time, we managed to intersect sales with visits and measure the success of each visit.**\n\n![](/images/repsly2_pic.png)\n\nTo make things easier, I have explored the Repsly API and wrote a [Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), which was set to pull the data on the visits daily. Numbers were fed, yet again, to our massive sheet and used within the same Data Studio report. An early version of the script is available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/simplemonad/pullRepsly), but use it at your own risk as I sadly don't have enough time to support it. Copy the code to the Google Script and create triggers as it suits you. It is important to note that the API returns the last 50 records so you should create an adequate number of triggers. I have set the triggers to run around midnight when there are no activities. Real-time data wasn't mission-critical in this case, so this worked more than well.\n\n![](/images/gitlab_src_pull.jpg)\n\n### Developing assessments criteria for fast decision making in the field\n\nField sales representatives work mostly on a mobile device and manage multiple accounts while being the face of a company within a particular territory. For them, **time is critical**, as a limited resource it is tightly connected to the results. Optimising their daily routes choosing which location to visit and when makes a difference.\n\nAs it was crucial for reps to have a fast signal I have developed a **Success Appraisal** mark based on a formula calculated for each client on a monthly and quarterly basis. **Success Appraisal** mark is the primary tool and orientation for sales reps as they help them to make quick decisions while in the field and at the same time, be confident in the outcome of the visit. In itself, the Success Appraisal mark held enough information that reps could use during their visits in discussions with buyers. It provided them with a **good idea of the volume in the last period, sales trend** (index of the increase/decrease) and **sales quantile** bucket. This data was fed back into Repsly for reps to have during the visits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReal data on sales and visits from the field reps were a **catalyst in our digital transformation**. The immediate effect was that _one sales representative quit_ in the first month. Others were more cooperative and are now using the data to **organise their routes better** and **develop more informed discussion points** with buyers. While **management got several ideas to optimise sales, develop bundles, actions and even develop entirely new products**.\n\n### My 6 general learnings in managing sales\n\n1. relations sell\n2. to have fantastic relationships you need **incredible people**\n3. communication needs to be **concise** and **honest**\n4. never forget **who is the real buyer**\n5. value of the offer is relative, and **you can maximise the financial outcome**\n6. for a meaningful result, **you need credible data**\n\n![Great visualisation of sales management done by pipedrive.com](/images/sales_managers_live.png?classes=caption \"Where great sales managers live, adapted from pipedrive.com\")"},{"slug":"innovation-acceleration-pit-stop-crews","category":"blog","title":"Innovation acceleration pit stop crews","description":"We need to do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers.

Researchers and companies are innovating, and creative solutions flow, mostly freely, between various entities. \n\nThis week I had the pleasure of advising two companies, one from Denmark and the other from France. Both develop state-of-the-art solutions, from mRNA treatments to advanced climate prediction models. I really enjoyed this opportunity to exercise my IP brain muscles. In both cases, the uncertainty of future prospects and lack of capacity for a comprehensive commercialisation feat was apparent.\n\nIf Europe wants to be at the forefront of innovation and growth, we must do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers. \n\nWhen handing out money, it is not enough to regulate the need for protection and commercialisation. We need to maximise business opportunities. \n\nWe need innovation acceleration pit stop crews. \n\nTop professionals versed in business and innovation, communication, and customer empathy. Professionals at crossroads. Professionals that can quickly jump to secure new tires and increase traction, check the engine, add fuel and refresh the driver. \n\nBut at one point, we have somehow convinced ourselves that we don't need them and that market can serve itself."},{"slug":"irresistible-offer","category":"blog","title":"How to tailor an irresistible offer","description":"Creating a perfect offer is not always simply about function—understanding your customers goes a long way helping you to optimise your offer for the benefit of both sides.","tags":["jbtd","sales"],"body":"\nHumans are mostly not rational. We are born irrational and with time are trained to be sensible, to build our mental models preparing ourselves for future challenges. We are even considered it offensive when someone calls us irrational. But despite this, I would argue that precisely this irrationality is making us interesting while creating negotiation opportunities.\n\nSo why are we always creating offers with mathematical precision? Does it even make sense to invest time in designing an offer without spending at least the same amount of time in understanding our buyer?\n\nCould this kind of pricing model be built with buyers irrationality counted in, and could we even develop a system for creating such models?\n\nI had an opportunity to approach a potential new client in the name of a company that I advised at that time. The usual practice was to provide the approached lead with a price list and offer them a fixed percentage discount which would increase with the endurance of the relationship. This was typical for the industry, and both sides expected such interaction negotiating on the discount percentage and driving the price low as it goes. Negotiations were done face to face with intermittent phone calls. We could have been selling nails or parachutes it wouldn't make the difference.\n\nI needed to understand the dynamics and all the peculiarities, including the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. I drafted a small to-do list:\n\n1. Discover everything about the product.\n2. Understand the current pricing strategy.\n3. Deconstruct current offer strategy.\n4. Find out what the competition was doing.\n5. Identify the job-to-be-done for the client.\n\nHonestly, there is a shortcut. You could jump straight to number 5. and then work from there.\n\n> \"A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.\", [jbtd.info](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)\n\n![SAMUEL HULICK USES THIS ILLUSTRATION TO SHOW HOW CUSTOMERS USE PRODUCTS TO DESIGN A \"NEW ME\".](/images/jobtobemario.jpeg?classes=caption \"Samuel Hulick uses this illustration to show how customers use products to design a New Me.\")\n\nAs the father of the concept, Clayton Christensen wrote:\n\n> Jobs are never simply about function—they have powerful social and emotional dimensions.\n\nRecognising those \"exotic\" dimensions in the forest of circumstances such as product attributes, new technologies or trends will provide you with ultimate leverage.\n\nOne typical circumstance is that your client has clients, and knowing them could be the first key. Based on this insight, you could go through the list of product strengths and find those that would trickle down to the end buyer—building your offer on such advantages. If this relationship is vital for your client, they will value such an approach.\n\nIn the case mentioned above, I had to dig deeper as it wasn't a straightforward answer. The relationship between my client and their clients was essential, but product strengths were low on the priority list. It was a simple case of vanity. My client just had to have something that would make them different, that would make them look good, even if sacrificing optimal sales. Obviously, they were interested in selling, but in their mind, they already had high sales, and now it was their time to shine.\n\nWith this realisation, I proceeded to design an ideal offer, one which would be a win-win case to maximise the value for both sides. The value perception, in this case, was asymmetric. For our side value was money in the bank, and for the other side it was good looks. The client which I advised made a killer, never before seen, margin. Based on the premise that their client valued something that they took for granted. They valued it more than standard industry volume discounts and whatnot.\n\nWe sold them a bespoke product with their name printed on it. We made them an irresistible offer.\n\nThis change cost my client peanuts while in return, their client got immense emotional value. Incorporating this into the pricing model would allow repeatability and consistent value capture."},{"slug":"marketing-and-sales-driving-revenue-in-profitable-saas-companies","category":"blog","title":"Marketing and Sales: Driving Revenue in Profitable SaaS Companies in 2023","description":"Improve your business success with this comprehensive guide to marketing and sales strategy.

Everyone, including their [goat](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/animal-zoom-calls-coronavirus-lockdown), is on Zoom nowadays. But is it the same, or are we losing something without even realizing it?\n\n\"Hell is other people\" is a famous quote by Sartre from his play No Exit:\n\n> \"All those eyes intent on me. Devouring me... So this is hell. I’d never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the “burning marl.” Old wives’ tales! There’s no need for red-hot pokers. HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE!\"\n\nLet's play with it and adapt it to the new reality:\n\n> \"Hell is other people on Zoom\".\n\nYesterday I was a part of two lengthy pan-European video meetings. They were quite different in terms of participants composition and objectives, but the same problem arose. Ultimately, democracy won over creativity.\n\nThe main problem of modern societies, and Europe in itself, is its culture of democracy. Being accustomed to the values of the society in which we live and breathe, we are automatically applying the same mental models at every stage of thinking and doing. This results in majority rule or absolute inclusiveness which spells disaster when the goal is creation. While it is well known that [individuals perform better than groups](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1201_1?journalCode=hbas20), we quickly go for groupthink equilibrium.\n\nThis is amplified in video meetings where it takes more effort to participate and is easier to inhibit extreme or prolific inputs which are prerequisites for creative productivity.\n\nA possible solution would be to take a different approach to virtual meetings. Because, alas, they are not the same. Individual brainstorming sessions as preparation for the meeting, or even better, during the meeting could be a good start. Strong facilitation of process but not content would be the next step.\n\nWe need to redesign our approach to meetings in an online environment. They just require a little more effort."}]
