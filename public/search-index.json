A black swan is an event that follows three criteria 1. unforeseen, unpredictable event, 2. of great importance, disturbance, and 3. tends to be rationalized in hindsight.\n\nApplying and broadening these ideas in the university ecosystem and considering them both in local and networked surroundings should be a worthy effort.\n\n## Universities disrupted\n\nUniversities' landscape is disrupted daily and is expected to drastically restructure in the following decades. \n\nThis is clear to the EC, which has initiated and invested in the European Universities Initiative to overcome the pressures of the global connected world on European universities.\n\nConsidering the massive impact of the internet in recent decades, we have seen significant reorientation of leading universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford to online environments. They have heavily invested in developing MOOCs and blended learning programs.\n\nIn the time of COVID, this has been more prominent as even the most traditional educational institutions were forced to do their best with online tools to deliver learning. Often, this resulted in an inelegant experience for everyone.\n\n## Digitalising research processes\n\nThe same things are happening in research, especially in those fields which are already, by their nature, digital. At the same time, we see more traditional research done remotely, such as in astrophysics, social sciences, and others.\n\n## The quintuple mission of universities\n\nUniversities are observed through the triple mission perspective and are expected to live in three dimensions: education, research, and applied research. \n\nWhile recently, we have seen a transformation to include additional dimensions of the environment and society, giving them a more relevant context and long-term vision. Transforming the triangle to a pentangle or, adding a time dimension, to a quintuple helix. \n\nUniversities should be active shapers of the future.\n\nMaking universities more interconnected should make them inherently more antifragile. Making them more responsible should make them more perceptive of their surrounding. \n\n## University dimensions\n\nBut we also need to consider each dimension as a separate system and approach the antifragility in each aspect, starting with education as the first and oldest mission.\n\nDeveloping blended and hybrid learning environments should provide a more expansive scaffold for action and reaction. \n\nMaking students more involved and connected. Making students more responsible. Making them owners of their own learning.\n\nMaking the research more digitalized and remotized should provide redundancies and options for easier access and use. \n\nCooperation with the business sector should be vigorous, but we have significant challenges. Working more intensively in connecting the efforts with education and research should increase the needed antifragility. At the same time, it could also increase fragility if not managed.\n\nInvolving broader society through direct engagement. Exposing them to education and research through lifelong learning, citizen science or something else. It could provide needed interactions as a basis for antifragility. \n\nThe environment is demanding, but strategically focusing research on the benefiting environment should give insights into the future.\n\n## reSEArch-EU\n\nIn the 2 million EUR Horizon 2020 project led by the \"European university of the seas\" alliance, I have designed a work package to tackle the antifragility of universities. \n\nRight now, there are no answers, not even whole questions.\n\nWe are planning to outline the right questions and maybe get some answers. The core idea is to institute the Antifragility Think-Tank to work freely and openly on this. \n\nTo explore opportunities for digitalization and remotization, especially of research infrastructure, to consider the environmental footprint of research practices, and to develop a system for transferring soft skills among the researchers.\n\n## Challenging concept to grasp\n\nAntifragility is not a natural way of thinking for us humans.\n\nBut it can be a useful mental model for considering the future of universities. \n\nEven if we don't reach the antifragility ideal."},{"slug":"balancing-homogeneity-and-heterogeneity-in-organizational-culture","category":"blog","title":"Balancing Homogeneity and Heterogeneity in Organizational Culture","description":"Find the balance between cultural homogeneity and heterogeneity in your organization.

You might also reward and recognize employees with new and creative ideas.\n\nBy figuring out and agreeing on your organization's values, beliefs, and behaviours, you can build a strong foundation for your culture and help ensure that everyone in the organization is working towards the same goal.\n\n## Reconciling trade-offs between cultural homogeneity and heterogeneity\n\nCultural homogeneity, in my opinion, relates to the degree to which a group or organization shares the same values, beliefs, and actions. \n\nThis can result in increased efficiency and cohesion, but it can also make the group or organization rigid and resistant to change.\n\nOn the other hand, cultural heterogeneity refers to the range of values, beliefs, and behaviours within a group or organization. \n\nThis can encourage innovation and resilience but can lead to conflicts and communication problems.\n\nIn a nutshell, homogeneity is like a well-oiled machine, but heterogeneity is like a box of chocolates: you never know what you'll get."},{"slug":"business-model-innovation-and-jtbd-for-startups","category":"blog","title":"Business Model Innovation and JTBD for Startups","description":"Boost your startup's growth with business model innovation and JTBD analysis.

So even if you manage the sales for the first time, you should firstly look for the numbers. You can quickly have answers to drive you and your team toward solid and repeatable results.\n\n### Understanding the context\n\nAt one point I was managing a small team of field representatives. **Selling real physical products was** a refresher but also **a massive challenge** as it involved real **people**, genuine **products** and **customers** spread all over the country. Everything was entirely new, plus I didn't have any previous experience on which I could base my self-confidence.\n\nThe setup that I had inherited was almost non-existent; abandoned manually updated \"MS Access\" **CRM** database and a bunch of private notes from the reps with no real transferable value or supporting context. Sales reps did a daily report which with time turned into truly meaningless musings looking almost the same every day. On the level of _\"She had a great shirt, next time I should ask where she bought it\"_. As much as this can be useful to a good salesman, we were missing a lot of actionable insights.\n\nWe had one weekly email report from the wholesalers as the only relevant sales record. **Everyone nervously waited for the Monday morning** to hear the aggregated number of sales for their territory, and that was it. More with fear did they manage to achieve the weekly target, which was arbitrarily set by the CEO. Targets were a problem in itself as they were fixed values and didn't take into account the growth of sales or any other fundamental specificity such as market size. Moreover, they didn't challenge the sales team to push further.\n\nI have invested some time to talk with each of the representatives and understand all the involved parties. Due to the history of doing things the same way, there was inherent resistance dreading potential disruption. Most of them had arranged their days conveniently with just that weekly target in mind. Some of them had lazy mornings, others loved to joyride, but honestly, they hardly worked their 8 hours. At the same time, due to the lack of central real-time data management, everything was kept in the heads of the reps and the company was in a hostage situation to them. **The change couldn't come out of the blue as it would hit us back in the head 100%.**\n\n### Provide value to your team from the start\n\nOne of the first ideas was to sift through the existing data and try to automate some parts of the process. This would have a twofold benefit, on one side we would have a **better picture of the sales** over several dimensions (buyers, geographies, products, etc.) and on the flip side, we would **provide our reps with feedback on their efforts**. This was a huge leap and value to the reps, which also confer trust, allowing them to see the results of their work.\n\n### Analysing sales with the help of Google Data Studio\n\n![](/images/gds_picture.png)\n\nData Studio from Google allows you to sift through **big data** and design pretty reports to inspire smarter business decisions. As is the case with other Google products, it is simple, yet powerful. It shouldn't take much time to orient around and design the first report. Challenge is elsewhere, how to confidently analyse the data and be sure that your interpretation is correct.\n\n> **TIP** Manual labour is honest. Avoid overkill setups. Do it as simple as you can, even if that means manual copy-pasting at first. When it proves itself, and you find valuable patterns in the process, you will easily find a way to automate it later.\n\nThe sales numbers came in from the third party (wholesaler) in the form of CSV file (comma separated values), so it was relatively easy to get them into [Google Data Studio](http://datastudio.google.com) with the **Google Sheets acting as a proxy**. One colleague in accounting got a new Monday morning task to copy-paste everything from a wholesaler email in a joint sheet while sipping the first coffee. Out of this massive sheet, I have designed 15 different pages in Data Studio each with several charts, **answering typical questions coming from management, sales reps and the production department**.\n\n### Management uptake is critical\n\nFor the first month or two, I have kept this under wraps to be sure that there are no errors that could easily be misused to provide arguments for the \"resistance\". Once I was convinced that everyone understands each page of the report, I have started introductions top-down. With management uptake secured, it was easier to proceed.\n\n### Finding where the sales team is spending their time\n\n![](/images/repsly_pic.png)\n\nOnce we had reports on sales, we were still missing data on the visits and contacts in the field. Two solutions that were simple to use and both ticked many of the marks were [Badger Maps](https://www.badgermapping.com) and [Repsly](https://www.repsly.com/). After some investigation and testing, we selected Repsly. **Repsly made the switch easy with its simplicity and good user experience.** It was intuitive, and our sales reps used it almost instantly with no need for explanations. Having the data at any given moment easily reachable was also happily welcomed by sales. More importantly, it had a useful [API](http://developer.repsly.com/repsly-developers) (Application Programming Interface), which allowed me to export their visits for analysis.\n\nThe prototype was hacked in 5 minutes using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (an automation tool with integrations in 1500+ apps) as it allowed me to connect Sheets and Repsly with just a few clicks. It was an instant success. **For the first time, we managed to intersect sales with visits and measure the success of each visit.**\n\n![](/images/repsly2_pic.png)\n\nTo make things easier, I have explored the Repsly API and wrote a [Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), which was set to pull the data on the visits daily. Numbers were fed, yet again, to our massive sheet and used within the same Data Studio report. An early version of the script is available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/simplemonad/pullRepsly), but use it at your own risk as I sadly don't have enough time to support it. Copy the code to the Google Script and create triggers as it suits you. It is important to note that the API returns the last 50 records so you should create an adequate number of triggers. I have set the triggers to run around midnight when there are no activities. Real-time data wasn't mission-critical in this case, so this worked more than well.\n\n![](/images/gitlab_src_pull.jpg)\n\n### Developing assessments criteria for fast decision making in the field\n\nField sales representatives work mostly on a mobile device and manage multiple accounts while being the face of a company within a particular territory. For them, **time is critical**, as a limited resource it is tightly connected to the results. Optimising their daily routes choosing which location to visit and when makes a difference.\n\nAs it was crucial for reps to have a fast signal I have developed a **Success Appraisal** mark based on a formula calculated for each client on a monthly and quarterly basis. **Success Appraisal** mark is the primary tool and orientation for sales reps as they help them to make quick decisions while in the field and at the same time, be confident in the outcome of the visit. In itself, the Success Appraisal mark held enough information that reps could use during their visits in discussions with buyers. It provided them with a **good idea of the volume in the last period, sales trend** (index of the increase/decrease) and **sales quantile** bucket. This data was fed back into Repsly for reps to have during the visits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReal data on sales and visits from the field reps were a **catalyst in our digital transformation**. The immediate effect was that _one sales representative quit_ in the first month. Others were more cooperative and are now using the data to **organise their routes better** and **develop more informed discussion points** with buyers. While **management got several ideas to optimise sales, develop bundles, actions and even develop entirely new products**.\n\n### My 6 general learnings in managing sales\n\n1. relations sell\n2. to have fantastic relationships you need **incredible people**\n3. communication needs to be **concise** and **honest**\n4. never forget **who is the real buyer**\n5. value of the offer is relative, and **you can maximise the financial outcome**\n6. for a meaningful result, **you need credible data**\n\n![Great visualisation of sales management done by pipedrive.com](/images/sales_managers_live.png?classes=caption \"Where great sales managers live, adapted from pipedrive.com\")"},{"slug":"how-i-wrote-a-book-last-night-unleashing-the-power-of-ai","category":"blog","title":"How I Wrote a Book Last Night","description":"Discover how AI was used to write a book in a single night.

Shifting to a structured AI-supported approach and allowing for \"ugly\" first drafts dramatically improves productivity.\n3. **The power of collaboration**: Combining the strengths of AI and human expertise, I created a compelling and cohesive book, complete with a detailed outline, structured chapters, and real-world examples.\n\n## How I Started Writing the Book\n\nA few years ago, during my vacation, I set a goal to **dedicate at least 30 minutes every night to writing**.\n\nI sat before my computer and poured my thoughts onto the screen, accumulating **20,000 words** over three to four weeks.\n\n## Discovering the Importance of Structure\n\nDuring the writing, I compiled all the important bits into a **concept file** to keep the clarity of the targets I set for the book.\n\nThis comprehensive document was not intended to be a part of the book, but it provided a deep understanding of the book's subject matter and its intended audience.\n\n> Concept file encompased all the essential details, such as the book's title, subtitle, **target audience, problems, pains, needs, and gains**.\n\nNext, I crafted a detailed outline resembling a table of contents, meticulously arranging chapters and sub-chapters in the most compelling way possible.\n\nI used [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to structure my content, simplify management, and improve content organization. \n\nI divided the book into chapters and sub-chapters, allowing me to create separate files for each sub-chapter.\n\n## Drafting instead of Editing\n\nOne lesson I learned from my previous failed attempt was the importance of avoiding over-editing during writing.\n\nInstead, I began by outlining the book in detail.\n\nFor each sub-chapter, I would write a few words as ideas developed.\n\nRather than writing linearly and going back to revise constantly, I focused on getting my initial ideas down, embracing imperfection, and avoiding over-editing.\n\n> In the words of Hemingway, **\"Write drunk, edit sober.\"** Even the \"ugly\" first draft could have significant value.\n\nHowever, after several weeks of writing, I realized that my words lacked coherence and required much more time investment, making it challenging to transform them into a book.\n\nSadly, this has put my little project on hold indefinitely.\n\nI wasn't ready to invest 6-9 months of writing.\n\n## Harnessing the Power of AI in Book Writing\n\nHere comes the turning point—the general availability of AI tools.\n\nExcited about the possibilities, I consolidated all my writing files into a single document and uploaded it to the Claude AI.\n\nClaude 2 is a powerful [large language model (LLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) with a 100k token context window. The power of Claude is that you can easily upload text files as part of the prompt.\n\nThe feedback I received from [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) acted as a catalyst, **re-igniting my motivation to continue with my book project.**\n\nI lost the initial prompts, but they were simple.\n\nHere is one of the simple prompts I used, and I have played with different \"personas\":\n\n```markdown\nImagine you are a scientist in the field of project management, and you are an experienced Horizon 2020 and Europe beneficiary. You also work as an expert evaluator for European Commission. Please review the book I have written, and provide me with a step-by-step list of improvements I could make to add more value to the readers.\n```\n\nThe AI provided detailed feedback comparable to an experienced editor specializing in non-fiction and scientific research writing.\n\n> It was like **a** **spark igniting a firework**; suddenly, the idea of completing and publishing the book seemed within reach.\n\n## Implementing AI Feedback in Book Writing\n\nWith the AI's comments and criticisms, I embarked on the next stage of **rewriting and restructuring the book**. \n\nI revised the outline to make it more in tune with my target audience.\n\n> The aim was to lead the reader seamlessly from beginning to end, ensuring their engagement throughout.\n\nThrilled with the results, I have now integrated GPT 3.5-turbo into my writing process, leveraging its flexibility through the [Better Chat GPT](https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT) interface.\n\nCrafting a system prompt became crucial.\n\nHere is an example of the starting system prompt I have been tweaking for some time now:\n\n```markdown\nYour name is GhostWriterGPT (Ghostwriting GPT), an AI inspired by Ernest Hemingway's brevity, Malcolm Gladwell's storytelling, and Philip Ball's research depth. Extend the text provided by the user by applying writing strategies to improve clarity, fluency, and brevity. Follow the given rules strictly:\n\n1. Use clear and concise language: Avoid jargon, slang, and complex words. Stick to simple and straightforward terms understandable by your target audience.\n2. Use active voice: Make your writing direct and easy to understand. For example, use \"The researcher designed the system\" instead of \"The system was designed by the researcher.\"\n3. Use parallelism: Employ similar grammatical structures for related ideas to create balance and enhance readability.\n4. Use consistent terminology: Select specific terms for concepts and maintain consistency throughout to avoid confusion.\n5. Use short sentences: Long sentences can be hard to follow. Aim for an average sentence length of 20 words or less.\n6. Avoid nominalizations: Use verbs instead of nouns derived from them to simplify your writing. For example, \"decide\" instead of \"decision-making.\"\n7. Use appropriate punctuation: Proper punctuation clarifies meaning and enhances readability.\n8. Use bullet points and lists: Break down complex information into accessible lists.\n9. Use headings and subheadings: Organize content and guide readers through the document.\n10. Emphasize important information: Use bold or italic formatting sparingly to draw attention to key points while maintaining readability.\n11. Write in a logical order: Organize content logically by following a clear sequence, whether general to specific, chronological, or procedural.\n12. Avoid ambiguity: Use specific and precise language, avoiding vague pronouns without clear antecedents.\n13. Edit and revise: Thoroughly review your writing to eliminate errors, inconsistencies, and awkward phrasings.\n14. Write using Markdown.\n\nApply these rules to the following text: \\\\[insert text here]\n```\n\n## Enriching Content and Ensuring Cohesion\n\nWhile the generated AI content now formed a substantial portion of my book, I needed to establish a comprehensive narrative, but some gaps still needed to be addressed.\n\nTo address this, I referred to my original 20,000 words and used them to fine-tune the generated AI text, adding depth and bringing it closer to my tone of voice.\n\nFor real-life case studies and examples, I have used [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/u/0/), which opened new opportunities with more current information.\n\n> Understanding each AI model's abilities and limits is crucial to achieving consistent results.\n\n## Orchestrating a Well-Structured Book through AI\n\nEntering a dedicated session with GPT, I selected the appropriate model, adjusted the temperature slightly up to 1.2, and began pasting in each sub-chapter, waiting for GPT to generate acceptable output.\n\n> After several attempts, I obtained coherent and relevant responses ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 words, perfectly suitable for inclusion in the book.\n\nThe subsequent sub-chapters flowed more seamlessly with input from its previously generated content. Here the 16k window of 3.5-turbo was crucial.\n\nI repeated this process until I had approximately **30,000 new words**.\n\n## The Final Push\n\nFinally, I assembled the segments into a single markdown file, including the newly generated content. The accumulated word count had now reached an impressive **40,000 words**.\n\nI reran it with Claude, experimenting with prompts for more feedback.\n\nAlthough a significant achievement, my book still required editing and refinement. And I don't have time nor nerves for this.\n\nNow it was the time to seek assistance from a human editor and proofreader to ensure the final product was refined, coherent, and value-driven.\n\nFor the coming months, I anticipate at least 100 hours of work to prepare the book for the new academic year.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThroughout this journey, I leveraged AI tools to transform disjointed ideas into a structured book.\n\nThe book primarily targets **young researchers**, drawing from my extensive **13-year experience in academia** and **my background managing €34 million worth of projects**.\n\n> The journey thus far has been engrossing, and I can't wait to see what my human editor will bring to the table.\n\n## Five Steps to Get Started Writing a Book with AI:\n\n1. **Begin with a Concept File and Outline**: Start by creating a concept file that outlines the key details of your book, such as title, subtitle, target audience, problems, pains, needs, and gains. Craft a detailed outline resembling a table of contents, compellingly arranging chapters and sub-chapters.\n2. **Draft and Gather Ideas**: Rather than worrying about perfection in the initial drafts, focus on pouring your ideas onto the page without strict editing. Write non-linearly and collect diverse ideas to have a substantial content bank.\n3. **Utilize AI to Enhance Your Writing**: Use AI tools, like Claude AI, to improve the content using your tone and style. Consolidate your writing files into one document and upload them to an AI platform. The AI can provide valuable feedback, suggestions, and improvements to enhance your work.\n4. **Enrich Content with AI**: Fine-tune the generated AI content by incorporating your unique voice and perspectives. Enhance the writing by referring to your original drafts and using AI models to add depth and clarity. Explore AI tools to supplement your work with relevant case studies, examples, and up-to-date information.\n5. **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously revise and refine your book by incorporating AI-generated content and feedback from AI tools. Create a harmonious flow between your ideas and the content generated by AI. Don't hesitate to seek assistance from human editors or proofreaders to ensure coherence and refine the final product.\n\nRemember, whether you aspire to write a book, create engaging articles, or establish a meaningful online presence. With **the right balance of human expertise and AI assistance, your potential is limitless.**\n\nNote: *This text was written using recorded audio notes, transcribed using Whisper.cpp, and then improved with the help of various AI models.*"},{"slug":"innovation-acceleration-pit-stop-crews","category":"blog","title":"Innovation acceleration pit stop crews","description":"We need to do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers.

We are born irrational and with time are trained to be sensible, to build our mental models preparing ourselves for future challenges. We are even considered it offensive when someone calls us irrational. But despite this, I would argue that precisely this irrationality is making us interesting while creating negotiation opportunities.\n\nSo why are we always creating offers with mathematical precision? Does it even make sense to invest time in designing an offer without spending at least the same amount of time in understanding our buyer?\n\nCould this kind of pricing model be built with buyers irrationality counted in, and could we even develop a system for creating such models?\n\nI had an opportunity to approach a potential new client in the name of a company that I advised at that time. The usual practice was to provide the approached lead with a price list and offer them a fixed percentage discount which would increase with the endurance of the relationship. This was typical for the industry, and both sides expected such interaction negotiating on the discount percentage and driving the price low as it goes. Negotiations were done face to face with intermittent phone calls. We could have been selling nails or parachutes it wouldn't make the difference.\n\nI needed to understand the dynamics and all the peculiarities, including the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. I drafted a small to-do list:\n\n1. Discover everything about the product.\n2. Understand the current pricing strategy.\n3. Deconstruct current offer strategy.\n4. Find out what the competition was doing.\n5. Identify the job-to-be-done for the client.\n\nHonestly, there is a shortcut. You could jump straight to number 5. and then work from there.\n\n> \"A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.\", [jbtd.info](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)\n\n![SAMUEL HULICK USES THIS ILLUSTRATION TO SHOW HOW CUSTOMERS USE PRODUCTS TO DESIGN A \"NEW ME\".](/images/jobtobemario.jpeg?classes=caption \"Samuel Hulick uses this illustration to show how customers use products to design a New Me.\")\n\nAs the father of the concept, Clayton Christensen wrote:\n\n> Jobs are never simply about function—they have powerful social and emotional dimensions.\n\nRecognising those \"exotic\" dimensions in the forest of circumstances such as product attributes, new technologies or trends will provide you with ultimate leverage.\n\nOne typical circumstance is that your client has clients, and knowing them could be the first key. Based on this insight, you could go through the list of product strengths and find those that would trickle down to the end buyer—building your offer on such advantages. If this relationship is vital for your client, they will value such an approach.\n\nIn the case mentioned above, I had to dig deeper as it wasn't a straightforward answer. The relationship between my client and their clients was essential, but product strengths were low on the priority list. It was a simple case of vanity. My client just had to have something that would make them different, that would make them look good, even if sacrificing optimal sales. Obviously, they were interested in selling, but in their mind, they already had high sales, and now it was their time to shine.\n\nWith this realisation, I proceeded to design an ideal offer, one which would be a win-win case to maximise the value for both sides. The value perception, in this case, was asymmetric. For our side value was money in the bank, and for the other side it was good looks. The client which I advised made a killer, never before seen, margin. Based on the premise that their client valued something that they took for granted. They valued it more than standard industry volume discounts and whatnot.\n\nWe sold them a bespoke product with their name printed on it. We made them an irresistible offer.\n\nThis change cost my client peanuts while in return, their client got immense emotional value.

With specific focus on client acquisition, customer retention, product innovation, and pricing optimization, OKRs offer a powerful framework for setting and measuring quantifiable goals. Learn how to use OKRs to become a profitable SaaS company and thrive in the ever-changing tech industry.","tags":["SaaS","profitability","OKRs","client acquisition","customer retention","product innovation"],"body":"Software as a Service (SaaS) has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most profitable sectors of the tech industry in recent years. \n\nDespite its rapid growth, however, achieving profitability in the SaaS space can be difficult. With fierce competition, high customer acquisition costs, and the constant need to innovate, SaaS companies must have a solid plan in place to achieve profitability.\n\nObjectives and Key Results are an effective tool for achieving profitability in the SaaS industry (OKR). This goal-setting method, pioneered by Andy Grove, Intel's co-founder and former CEO, can assist SaaS companies in setting clear, measurable goals and tracking progress toward achieving them.\n\nAs someone who has spent several years working in the SaaS industry, I know firsthand how difficult it can be to achieve profitability. \n\nIt is not enough to have a fantastic product; you must also have a solid strategy in place to attract and retain customers, innovate quickly, and optimize your pricing strategy. That is why I believe Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are such an effective tool for SaaS companies.\n\nOKRs can help SaaS companies stay focused on what really matters and achieve profitability over time by setting clear, measurable goals and tracking progress toward them. I've seen this in my own experience and with clients I've worked with, and I'm confident that OKRs can help any SaaS company meet its profitability targets.\n\nHere are some ways that SaaS companies can use OKRs to achieve profitability:\n\n1. **Increase Customer Acquisition:** Setting OKRs around customer acquisition can help SaaS companies identify the channels and strategies that are most effective at driving new business. SaaS companies can use OKRs to set specific goals for acquiring new customers, whether through advertising, content marketing, or other methods, and then track progress toward those goals.\n2. **Retain Existing Customers:** Customer retention is critical for SaaS companies to achieve profitability. Setting OKRs for customer retention can help businesses identify and address the factors that contribute to customer churn. By tracking progress toward these objectives, SaaS companies can better understand which strategies are most effective at customer retention and adjust their approach as needed.\n3. **Drive Product Innovation:** In the SaaS industry, staying ahead of the competition requires constant innovation. OKRs for product development can assist SaaS companies in prioritizing innovation and setting clear goals for developing new features and functionality. SaaS companies can ensure they're constantly improving their product and staying ahead of the curve by tracking progress toward these goals.\n4. **Optimize Pricing and Packaging:** In the SaaS industry, pricing and packaging are critical to achieving profitability.

Understanding your customers helps you to develop a product that truly meets their needs and solves their problems. This, in turn, leads to increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy.

You can use a variety of methods, such as surveys, focus groups, and interviews, to gather this information.\n2.

Use this data to gain insights into your target audience and their needs.\n3. Engage with your customers - Talk to your customers and find out what they like and dislike about your product. Ask them what they need and want, and use this information to inform your product development.\n\n<a id=\"#key-considerations-for-identifying-customer-problems\"></a>\n## Key Considerations for Identifying Customer Problems\nWhen identifying customer problems, it's important to consider the following:\n\n1. Pain points - What are the issues that are causing your customers frustration and dissatisfaction?\n2. Desired outcomes - What does your customer hope to achieve with your product?\n3.

Everyone, including their [goat](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/animal-zoom-calls-coronavirus-lockdown), is on Zoom nowadays. But is it the same, or are we losing something without even realizing it?\n\n\"Hell is other people\" is a famous quote by Sartre from his play No Exit:\n\n> \"All those eyes intent on me. Devouring me... So this is hell. I’d never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the “burning marl.” Old wives’ tales! There’s no need for red-hot pokers. HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE!\"\n\nLet's play with it and adapt it to the new reality:\n\n> \"Hell is other people on Zoom\".\n\nYesterday I was a part of two lengthy pan-European video meetings. They were quite different in terms of participants composition and objectives, but the same problem arose. Ultimately, democracy won over creativity.\n\nThe main problem of modern societies, and Europe in itself, is its culture of democracy. Being accustomed to the values of the society in which we live and breathe, we are automatically applying the same mental models at every stage of thinking and doing. This results in majority rule or absolute inclusiveness which spells disaster when the goal is creation. While it is well known that [individuals perform better than groups](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1201_1?journalCode=hbas20), we quickly go for groupthink equilibrium.\n\nThis is amplified in video meetings where it takes more effort to participate and is easier to inhibit extreme or prolific inputs which are prerequisites for creative productivity.\n\nA possible solution would be to take a different approach to virtual meetings. Because, alas, they are not the same. Individual brainstorming sessions as preparation for the meeting, or even better, during the meeting could be a good start. Strong facilitation of process but not content would be the next step.\n\nWe need to redesign our approach to meetings in an online environment. They just require a little more effort."}]
