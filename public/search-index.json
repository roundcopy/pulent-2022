We are born irrational and with time are trained to be sensible, to build our mental models preparing ourselves for future challenges. We are even considered it offensive when someone calls us irrational. But despite this, I would argue that precisely this irrationality is making us interesting while creating negotiation opportunities.\n\nSo why are we always creating offers with mathematical precision? Does it even make sense to invest time in designing an offer without spending at least the same amount of time in understanding our buyer?\n\nCould this kind of pricing model be built with buyers irrationality counted in, and could we even develop a system for creating such models?\n\nI had an opportunity to approach a potential new client in the name of a company that I advised at that time. The usual practice was to provide the approached lead with a price list and offer them a fixed percentage discount which would increase with the endurance of the relationship. This was typical for the industry, and both sides expected such interaction negotiating on the discount percentage and driving the price low as it goes. Negotiations were done face to face with intermittent phone calls. We could have been selling nails or parachutes it wouldn't make the difference.\n\nI needed to understand the dynamics and all the peculiarities, including the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. I drafted a small to-do list:\n\n1. Discover everything about the product.\n2. Understand the current pricing strategy.\n3. Deconstruct current offer strategy.\n4. Find out what the competition was doing.\n5. Identify the job-to-be-done for the client.\n\nHonestly, there is a shortcut. You could jump straight to number 5. and then work from there.\n\n> \"A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.\", [jbtd.info](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca)\n\n![SAMUEL HULICK USES THIS ILLUSTRATION TO SHOW HOW CUSTOMERS USE PRODUCTS TO DESIGN A \"NEW ME\".](/images/jobtobemario.jpeg?classes=caption \"Samuel Hulick uses this illustration to show how customers use products to design a New Me.\")\n\nAs the father of the concept, Clayton Christensen wrote:\n\n> Jobs are never simply about function—they have powerful social and emotional dimensions.\n\nRecognising those \"exotic\" dimensions in the forest of circumstances such as product attributes, new technologies or trends will provide you with ultimate leverage.\n\nOne typical circumstance is that your client has clients, and knowing them could be the first key. Based on this insight, you could go through the list of product strengths and find those that would trickle down to the end buyer—building your offer on such advantages. If this relationship is vital for your client, they will value such an approach.\n\nIn the case mentioned above, I had to dig deeper as it wasn't a straightforward answer. The relationship between my client and their clients was essential, but product strengths were low on the priority list. It was a simple case of vanity. My client just had to have something that would make them different, that would make them look good, even if sacrificing optimal sales. Obviously, they were interested in selling, but in their mind, they already had high sales, and now it was their time to shine.\n\nWith this realisation, I proceeded to design an ideal offer, one which would be a win-win case to maximise the value for both sides. The value perception, in this case, was asymmetric. For our side value was money in the bank, and for the other side it was good looks. The client which I advised made a killer, never before seen, margin. Based on the premise that their client valued something that they took for granted. They valued it more than standard industry volume discounts and whatnot.\n\nWe sold them a bespoke product with their name printed on it. We made them an irresistible offer.\n\nThis change cost my client peanuts while in return, their client got immense emotional value. Incorporating this into the pricing model would allow repeatability and consistent value capture."},{"slug":"2020-01-02-field-team","category":"blog","title":"How to efficiently manage a small field sales team","description":"Using data and reporting tools to boost sales in a traditionaly oriented company.","tags":["field","sales","team"],"body":"\nNo matter how small your team is, it will generate valuable data. So even if you manage the sales for the first time, you should firstly look for the numbers. You can quickly have answers to drive you and your team toward solid and repeatable results.\n\n### Understanding the context\n\nAt one point I was managing a small team of field representatives. **Selling real physical products was** a refresher but also **a massive challenge** as it involved real **people**, genuine **products** and **customers** spread all over the country. Everything was entirely new, plus I didn't have any previous experience on which I could base my self-confidence.\n\nThe setup that I had inherited was almost non-existent; abandoned manually updated \"MS Access\" **CRM** database and a bunch of private notes from the reps with no real transferable value or supporting context. Sales reps did a daily report which with time turned into truly meaningless musings looking almost the same every day. On the level of _\"She had a great shirt, next time I should ask where she bought it\"_. As much as this can be useful to a good salesman, we were missing a lot of actionable insights.\n\nWe had one weekly email report from the wholesalers as the only relevant sales record. **Everyone nervously waited for the Monday morning** to hear the aggregated number of sales for their territory, and that was it. More with fear did they manage to achieve the weekly target, which was arbitrarily set by the CEO. Targets were a problem in itself as they were fixed values and didn't take into account the growth of sales or any other fundamental specificity such as market size. Moreover, they didn't challenge the sales team to push further.\n\nI have invested some time to talk with each of the representatives and understand all the involved parties. Due to the history of doing things the same way, there was inherent resistance dreading potential disruption. Most of them had arranged their days conveniently with just that weekly target in mind. Some of them had lazy mornings, others loved to joyride, but honestly, they hardly worked their 8 hours. At the same time, due to the lack of central real-time data management, everything was kept in the heads of the reps and the company was in a hostage situation to them. **The change couldn't come out of the blue as it would hit us back in the head 100%.**\n\n### Provide value to your team from the start\n\nOne of the first ideas was to sift through the existing data and try to automate some parts of the process. This would have a twofold benefit, on one side we would have a **better picture of the sales** over several dimensions (buyers, geographies, products, etc.) and on the flip side, we would **provide our reps with feedback on their efforts**. This was a huge leap and value to the reps, which also confer trust, allowing them to see the results of their work.\n\n### Analysing sales with the help of Google Data Studio\n\n![](/images/gds_picture.png)\n\nData Studio from Google allows you to sift through **big data** and design pretty reports to inspire smarter business decisions. As is the case with other Google products, it is simple, yet powerful. It shouldn't take much time to orient around and design the first report. Challenge is elsewhere, how to confidently analyse the data and be sure that your interpretation is correct.\n\n> **TIP** Manual labour is honest. Avoid overkill setups. Do it as simple as you can, even if that means manual copy-pasting at first. When it proves itself, and you find valuable patterns in the process, you will easily find a way to automate it later.\n\nThe sales numbers came in from the third party (wholesaler) in the form of CSV file (comma separated values), so it was relatively easy to get them into [Google Data Studio](http://datastudio.google.com) with the **Google Sheets acting as a proxy**. One colleague in accounting got a new Monday morning task to copy-paste everything from a wholesaler email in a joint sheet while sipping the first coffee. Out of this massive sheet, I have designed 15 different pages in Data Studio each with several charts, **answering typical questions coming from management, sales reps and the production department**.\n\n### Management uptake is critical\n\nFor the first month or two, I have kept this under wraps to be sure that there are no errors that could easily be misused to provide arguments for the \"resistance\". Once I was convinced that everyone understands each page of the report, I have started introductions top-down. With management uptake secured, it was easier to proceed.\n\n### Finding where the sales team is spending their time\n\n![](/images/repsly_pic.png)\n\nOnce we had reports on sales, we were still missing data on the visits and contacts in the field. Two solutions that were simple to use and both ticked many of the marks were [Badger Maps](https://www.badgermapping.com) and [Repsly](https://www.repsly.com/). After some investigation and testing, we selected Repsly. **Repsly made the switch easy with its simplicity and good user experience.** It was intuitive, and our sales reps used it almost instantly with no need for explanations. Having the data at any given moment easily reachable was also happily welcomed by sales. More importantly, it had a useful [API](http://developer.repsly.com/repsly-developers) (Application Programming Interface), which allowed me to export their visits for analysis.\n\nThe prototype was hacked in 5 minutes using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) (an automation tool with integrations in 1500+ apps) as it allowed me to connect Sheets and Repsly with just a few clicks. It was an instant success. **For the first time, we managed to intersect sales with visits and measure the success of each visit.**\n\n![](/images/repsly2_pic.png)\n\nTo make things easier, I have explored the Repsly API and wrote a [Google Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/), which was set to pull the data on the visits daily. Numbers were fed, yet again, to our massive sheet and used within the same Data Studio report. An early version of the script is available on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/simplemonad/pullRepsly), but use it at your own risk as I sadly don't have enough time to support it. Copy the code to the Google Script and create triggers as it suits you. It is important to note that the API returns the last 50 records so you should create an adequate number of triggers. I have set the triggers to run around midnight when there are no activities. Real-time data wasn't mission-critical in this case, so this worked more than well.\n\n![](/images/gitlab_src_pull.jpg)\n\n### Developing assessments criteria for fast decision making in the field\n\nField sales representatives work mostly on a mobile device and manage multiple accounts while being the face of a company within a particular territory. For them, **time is critical**, as a limited resource it is tightly connected to the results. Optimising their daily routes choosing which location to visit and when makes a difference.\n\nAs it was crucial for reps to have a fast signal I have developed a **Success Appraisal** mark based on a formula calculated for each client on a monthly and quarterly basis. **Success Appraisal** mark is the primary tool and orientation for sales reps as they help them to make quick decisions while in the field and at the same time, be confident in the outcome of the visit. In itself, the Success Appraisal mark held enough information that reps could use during their visits in discussions with buyers. It provided them with a **good idea of the volume in the last period, sales trend** (index of the increase/decrease) and **sales quantile** bucket. This data was fed back into Repsly for reps to have during the visits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReal data on sales and visits from the field reps were a **catalyst in our digital transformation**. The immediate effect was that _one sales representative quit_ in the first month. Others were more cooperative and are now using the data to **organise their routes better** and **develop more informed discussion points** with buyers. While **management got several ideas to optimise sales, develop bundles, actions and even develop entirely new products**.\n\n### My 6 general learnings in managing sales\n\n1. relations sell\n2. to have fantastic relationships you need **incredible people**\n3. communication needs to be **concise** and **honest**\n4. never forget **who is the real buyer**\n5. value of the offer is relative, and **you can maximise the financial outcome**\n6. for a meaningful result, **you need credible data**\n\n![Great visualisation of sales management done by pipedrive.com](/images/sales_managers_live.png?classes=caption \"Where great sales managers live, adapted from pipedrive.com\")"},{"slug":"2020-01-02-video-meetings","category":"blog","title":"Democracy as creativity antidote in video meetings","description":"Hell is other people on Zoom.","tags":["zoom","meetings","people"],"body":"\nOne great thing resulting from the COVID-19 situation is that now it is easier than ever to substitute real in-person meetings with virtual ones. Everyone, including their [goat](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/animal-zoom-calls-coronavirus-lockdown), is on Zoom nowadays. But is it the same, or are we losing something without even realizing it?\n\n\"Hell is other people\" is a famous quote by Sartre from his play No Exit:\n\n> \"All those eyes intent on me. Devouring me... So this is hell. I’d never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the “burning marl.” Old wives’ tales! There’s no need for red-hot pokers. HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE!\"\n\nLet's play with it and adapt it to the new reality:\n\n> \"Hell is other people on Zoom\".\n\nYesterday I was a part of two lengthy pan-European video meetings. They were quite different in terms of participants composition and objectives, but the same problem arose. Ultimately, democracy won over creativity.\n\nThe main problem of modern societies, and Europe in itself, is its culture of democracy. Being accustomed to the values of the society in which we live and breathe, we are automatically applying the same mental models at every stage of thinking and doing. This results in majority rule or absolute inclusiveness which spells disaster when the goal is creation. While it is well known that [individuals perform better than groups](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1201_1?journalCode=hbas20), we quickly go for groupthink equilibrium.\n\nThis is amplified in video meetings where it takes more effort to participate and is easier to inhibit extreme or prolific inputs which are prerequisites for creative productivity.\n\nA possible solution would be to take a different approach to virtual meetings. Because, alas, they are not the same. Individual brainstorming sessions as preparation for the meeting, or even better, during the meeting could be a good start. Strong facilitation of process but not content would be the next step.\n\nWe need to redesign our approach to meetings in an online environment. They just require a little more effort."},{"slug":"2020-09-01-antifragile-university","category":"blog","title":"Antifragility of universities","description":"Antifragility is a challenging concept and it is sometimes hard to grasp but can be a useful mental model when thinking about the future of universities.","tags":["antifragility","universities","europe"],"body":"\nAs defined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, antifragility is a property of a system to not only resist but to thrive in extraordinary circumstances. To thrive in times of hardship. This concept is also connected to the black swan idea as he has coined it in his book of the same name. A black swan is an event that follows three criteria 1. unforeseen, unpredictable event, 2. of great importance, disturbance, 3. tends to be rationalized in hindsight.\n\nApplying and broadening these concepts in the ecosystem of universities and considering it both in local and networked surroundings should be a worthy investment.\n\nUniversities' landscape is changing every day and is expected to drastically restructure in the following decades. This is even obvious to the EC which has initiated and invested in the European Universities Initiative to overcome the pressures of the global connected world on European universities.\n\nConsidering the massive impact of the internet in recent decades we have seen significant reorientation of leading universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford to online environments. They have heavily invested in developing MOOCs and blended learning programs.\n\nIn the time of COVID, this has been more prominent as even the smallest education institutions are now forced to dabble with online tools to deliver learnings that were prepared for in face knowledge transfer resulting in clumsy experiences for students.\n\nThe same things are happening in research, especially in those fields which are already by their nature digitalized, but also we are seeing more traditional research done almost exclusively remotely such as astrophysics, social sciences, etc.\n\nUniversities are observed through the triangle perspective and it is expected from them to live in three dimensions of education, research, and commercialization or applied research. While recently we are seeing reorientation to include additional dimensions of the environment and society giving them a more relevant context and more long term vision. Transforming the triangle to a prism or a quintuple helix. Universities should be thought of as shapers of the future.\n\nMaking universities more interconnected should make them inherently more antifragile. Making them more responsible should make them more perceptive of their surrounding. But we need also to consider each dimension as a separate system and approach the antifragility in each of the aspects starting with the first mission of education.\n\nDeveloping blended and hybrid learning environments should provide a wider platform for action and reaction. Making students more involved and interconnected should prove helpful in this sense, making them more responsible.\n\nMaking the research more digitalized and remotized should provide redundancies and options for access and use. Cooperation with the business sector should be robust enough, but we are having significant challenges, and working more intensively in connecting these efforts with education and research inputs and outputs should provide the needed antifragility but at the same time could increase fragility if not managed mindfully.\n\nInvolving society through the engagement of citizens and exposing them to both education and research with life long learning or citizen science, and the third mission with leading them towards more entrepreneurial activities could provide needed interaction which could be a basis for antifragility. The environment is a tough one, but strategically focusing research towards the benefiting environment should at least give as insights in the future.\n\nIn 2 million EUR Horizon 2020 project just selected for financing and lead by \"European university of the seas\" alliance, I have designed a work package to tackle the antifragility of universities. Right now I don't have any answers but we are planning to find them or at least to find and ask the right questions. The core activities are to start the antifragility think-tank to work on this in continuity, to explore opportunities for digitalization and remotization especially of research infrastructure, and to consider the environmental footprint of research practices while also working on a system for transferring soft skills between the researches and working on their development and increase of human capital.\n\nAntifragility is a challenging concept and it is sometimes hard to grasp but can be a useful mental model when thinking about the future of universities. Even if we don't approach the antifragility ideal."},{"slug":"2021-12-15-innovation-acceleration-pit-stop-crews","category":"blog","title":"Innovation acceleration pit stop crews","description":"We need to do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers. We need to maximise business opportunities.

The only change is that TT is no longer a buzzword which when used in your proposal or during a posh lunch would make you instantly uber-cool. Today we are all getting excited by digital transformation, green transitions and whatnot. Time has passed.\n\nWhat happened? It probably was a too big bite for the majority. To be honest, it is not an easy job. So why bother after the grant money runs out. Institutions have trouble covering the operational expenses how can they develop the competencies and team needed to do the TT. Also, the lifecycle of any TT opportunity is much longer than typical political cycles. So it is guaranteed that you will be repeating yourself constantly, and without much result. It is much easier to jump on the next keyword and ride it.\n\nAt the same time, all over Europe, a lot of investment is happening. Researchers and companies are innovating and creative solutions are flowing, mostly freely, between various entities. This week I had the pleasure of advising two companies, one from Denmark and the other from France. Both are developing state of art solutions, from mRNA treatments to advanced climate prediction models. I had really enjoyed this opportunity to exercise my IP brain muscles. In both cases, the uncertainty of future prospects and lack of capacity for a comprehensive commercialisation feat was clear.\n\nWhat is obvious, if Europe really wants to be at the forefront of innovation and growth, we need to do our best to increase statistical chances for innovation to reach customers. It is not enough to regulate the need for protection and commercialisation when handing out money. We need to maximise business opportunities. We need innovation acceleration pit stop crews.
